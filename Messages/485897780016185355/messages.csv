628372354803826699,2019-09-30 23:27:23.979000+00:00,It seems like it would be hard to fit it into tge 8 minute time limit,

628372108036014090,2019-09-30 23:26:25.145000+00:00,And after that its just perfect mana fixing,
628371949231407124,2019-09-30 23:25:47.283000+00:00,Not even that good,
628371912086781952,2019-09-30 23:25:38.427000+00:00,Like what its 2 for one or 3 for one?,
628371731563675650,2019-09-30 23:24:55.387000+00:00,Yeah honestly repeatedly killing x/1s isnt that great,
628350767333507086,2019-09-30 22:01:37.125000+00:00,Oof,
628303581476552735,2019-09-30 18:54:07.140000+00:00,But interaction is fun,
628303554821750784,2019-09-30 18:54:00.785000+00:00,I like the explosivness of zoo,
628300538991214595,2019-09-30 18:42:01.755000+00:00,idk ig ill think about it and test decks on mtgo before i buy,
628300493151666214,2019-09-30 18:41:50.826000+00:00,yh and i could always upgrade into traverse,
628299499416190986,2019-09-30 18:37:53.901000+00:00,mardu would be like 300-400,
628299446345662487,2019-09-30 18:37:41.248000+00:00,zoo has goyf which is 2/3s of the cost,
628299401617735682,2019-09-30 18:37:30.584000+00:00,and it less staples,
628299385796689930,2019-09-30 18:37:26.812000+00:00,like by 100,
628299357522886663,2019-09-30 18:37:20.071000+00:00,mardu is more expensive for me tho,
628298474399465493,2019-09-30 18:33:49.518000+00:00,suicide zoo seems a bit more like infect,
628298442157850644,2019-09-30 18:33:41.831000+00:00,mardu shadow is better and more consistant in the long game i think,
628282556730572860,2019-09-30 17:30:34.450000+00:00,Hmm mb i should just build mardu shadow instead since interaction is fun,
628263165456809985,2019-09-30 16:13:31.210000+00:00,cuz mutagenic growth is crazy with ds,
628263127095443458,2019-09-30 16:13:22.064000+00:00,sometimes u can just battle rage ko on turn 2,
628263078647169053,2019-09-30 16:13:10.513000+00:00,the deck is p fun to play,
628262546524078101,2019-09-30 16:11:03.645000+00:00,but those decks are not tier 1,
628262523212136472,2019-09-30 16:10:58.087000+00:00,i mean yh some decks can get it down quicker,
628262279670005800,2019-09-30 16:10:00.022000+00:00,also yeah brennar if its turn 3 and i dont have a decent amount of power on the board im probs in a bad spot anyway,

625146207404163103,2019-09-22 01:47:50.500000+00:00,like mtgo is switching the draft from modern cube to standard next week,
625146153264218122,2019-09-22 01:47:37.592000+00:00,standard just sucks ass in general,
625144987071414292,2019-09-22 01:42:59.550000+00:00,opening packs is more fun,

624732675776970762,2019-09-20 22:24:36.877000+00:00,for invoker you have plenty of methods,

624732487297400844,2019-09-20 22:23:51.940000+00:00,its better than banefire,
624732397082116096,2019-09-20 22:23:30.431000+00:00,i think invoker is also better because you can grab it off duskwatch recruiter,
624732016306552847,2019-09-20 22:21:59.647000+00:00,mana doesnt matter if ur infinite,

624731814849675324,2019-09-20 22:21:11.616000+00:00,legit probs better,
624731720628830228,2019-09-20 22:20:49.152000+00:00,like walking ballista,
624731703683842058,2019-09-20 22:20:45.112000+00:00,and you should do something else,
624731680305053706,2019-09-20 22:20:39.538000+00:00,that banefire is just bad for this deck,

624731354583531542,2019-09-20 22:19:21.880000+00:00,eh idk if manamorphose is what you want,
624731238963478530,2019-09-20 22:18:54.314000+00:00,bobby u should modern cube with me,
624731017667936276,2019-09-20 22:18:01.553000+00:00,deck thinning for that type of deck seems fine,
624730989222035466,2019-09-20 22:17:54.771000+00:00,but eh,
624730977431715843,2019-09-20 22:17:51.960000+00:00,like probably not,
624730961296359428,2019-09-20 22:17:48.113000+00:00,honestly maybe,
624730946406711307,2019-09-20 22:17:44.563000+00:00,hmm,
624668762490142741,2019-09-20 18:10:38.762000+00:00,that would be funny,
624668739777986580,2019-09-20 18:10:33.347000+00:00,lel,
624668517752504362,2019-09-20 18:09:40.412000+00:00,but having a repeatble way to do damage can be strong,
624668457178234890,2019-09-20 18:09:25.970000+00:00,obviously not as good,
624668432541155354,2019-09-20 18:09:20.096000+00:00,!card punishing fire,
624668416791543839,2019-09-20 18:09:16.341000+00:00,i think it could be good for the same reason punishing fire is good,
624668262583631893,2019-09-20 18:08:39.575000+00:00,the fact that you can mill your self and then cast it is interesting,
624668198725484555,2019-09-20 18:08:24.350000+00:00,hmm true,
624668148498432010,2019-09-20 18:08:12.375000+00:00,the question is whether there is a not terrible combo,
624668093754507283,2019-09-20 18:07:59.323000+00:00,i mean there is a 100% chance theres some convulted combo,
624667763436158986,2019-09-20 18:06:40.569000+00:00,cuz ur a dummy,
624667600126738433,2019-09-20 18:06:01.633000+00:00,casting stuff from exile and what not,
624667570733187092,2019-09-20 18:05:54.625000+00:00,it seems breakable,
624667360149897236,2019-09-20 18:05:04.418000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/624667359688261653/zxptnvslrpn31.png
624667228683632670,2019-09-20 18:04:33.074000+00:00,u dummy,
624666812596092998,2019-09-20 18:02:53.871000+00:00,it would stay on while its an artifact and do nothing,
624666784552714251,2019-09-20 18:02:47.185000+00:00,if you were to put a +1/+1 counter on it while its a creature,
624666744434196493,2019-09-20 18:02:37.620000+00:00,a card like phyrexian totem,
624666727648591887,2019-09-20 18:02:33.618000+00:00,a good example would be,
624666712339644417,2019-09-20 18:02:29.968000+00:00,hmm,
624666401797570560,2019-09-20 18:01:15.929000+00:00,and yh ray blast zone not hitting 0 cmc sutff is its biggest weakness,
624666351734095909,2019-09-20 18:01:03.993000+00:00,i think you're over thinking this brennar tbh,
624666255369961521,2019-09-20 18:00:41.018000+00:00,yeah i dont think this would require much if anything,
624666046875303975,2019-09-20 17:59:51.309000+00:00,yeah blast zone would be better if it came in with 0,
624665981817585674,2019-09-20 17:59:35.798000+00:00,i dont think they need to change any rules for this,
624665927878705185,2019-09-20 17:59:22.938000+00:00,and what that does depends on the premenat type,
624665889823916042,2019-09-20 17:59:13.865000+00:00,my impressions is that counters can go on anything,
624665822551605258,2019-09-20 17:58:57.826000+00:00,why couldnt they go on non creature artifacts,
624665785419300875,2019-09-20 17:58:48.973000+00:00,and you can put +1/+1 counters on lands too right?,
624665695015141387,2019-09-20 17:58:27.419000+00:00,!card blast zone,
624665650434146314,2019-09-20 17:58:16.790000+00:00,!card chalice of the void,
624665538026536970,2019-09-20 17:57:49.990000+00:00,everflowing chalice,
624665518179352596,2019-09-20 17:57:45.258000+00:00,chalice,
624665508330995732,2019-09-20 17:57:42.910000+00:00,yh,
624665394157977641,2019-09-20 17:57:15.689000+00:00,would this not be the same as surge node,
624665333407547412,2019-09-20 17:57:01.205000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/624665332950499361/12414fc0-bb24-4244-baf4-adad0125376e.png
624665199152070656,2019-09-20 17:56:29.196000+00:00,I imagine its pretty much the same thing,
624665158110937141,2019-09-20 17:56:19.411000+00:00,even if it does nothing,
624665145632620604,2019-09-20 17:56:16.436000+00:00,and you can put a charger counter on a creature,
624665112359338015,2019-09-20 17:56:08.503000+00:00,like theres that artifact that puts charge counters on things,
624665016217501697,2019-09-20 17:55:45.581000+00:00,even if it doesnt do anything,
624664975222505484,2019-09-20 17:55:35.807000+00:00,honestly i always thought that anything could have any kind of counter,
624664932486479884,2019-09-20 17:55:25.618000+00:00,hmm,
624664463458435102,2019-09-20 17:53:33.793000+00:00,wdym?,
624650142255022081,2019-09-20 16:56:39.352000+00:00,can i cum to practice,
624634362759086094,2019-09-20 15:53:57.227000+00:00,this is what magic is now,
624634348372754466,2019-09-20 15:53:53.797000+00:00,the meta of all formats will be dominated by teferi mirror matches,
624634267275624468,2019-09-20 15:53:34.462000+00:00,control in all formats will just be teferi tribal,

621869120501186571,2019-09-13 00:45:52.097000+00:00,otherwise mardu shadow is still a contender,

621806654438113287,2019-09-12 20:37:39.027000+00:00,Among other things,
621806627456155668,2019-09-12 20:37:32.594000+00:00,Berween fow and wasteland,
621806578542182410,2019-09-12 20:37:20.932000+00:00,It would still cost a few hundo tho,
621806095664414740,2019-09-12 20:35:25.805000+00:00,But djinn can be removed in other ways,
621806043621621770,2019-09-12 20:35:13.397000+00:00,Same with w6,
621806020959797248,2019-09-12 20:35:07.994000+00:00,And unflipped dilver,

621805789291741217,2019-09-12 20:34:12.760000+00:00,Although the meta is honestly bad for that type of deck rn,
621805381693472789,2019-09-12 20:32:35.581000+00:00,Pteramander is probs playable,
621805270452142105,2019-09-12 20:32:09.059000+00:00,Tempest djinn bad,
621804446287921161,2019-09-12 20:28:52.563000+00:00,Ud probs be better off with ub shadow without the duals,
621804069325111337,2019-09-12 20:27:22.688000+00:00,Depending on the meta,
621804004258742293,2019-09-12 20:27:07.175000+00:00,And sometimes win games,
621803964073115667,2019-09-12 20:26:57.594000+00:00,I think u could do that,
621803033331892283,2019-09-12 20:23:15.688000+00:00,So start playing legacy,
621803004802236436,2019-09-12 20:23:08.886000+00:00,Also brennar u wont know till u try,
621802283881070593,2019-09-12 20:20:17.005000+00:00,Vintage kinda gay ngl,
621802160648093726,2019-09-12 20:19:47.624000+00:00,Lol sure,
621802106860339228,2019-09-12 20:19:34.800000+00:00,I dont play modern,
621801888832028682,2019-09-12 20:18:42.818000+00:00,And seeing lines is part of deck knowlege and experience,
621801801901015090,2019-09-12 20:18:22.092000+00:00,Also format knowlege is a big part of playing around things,
621801604257153035,2019-09-12 20:17:34.970000+00:00,Ig those puzzels i see on reddit sometimes?,
621801523550093322,2019-09-12 20:17:15.728000+00:00,But format knowlege is huge in draft,
621801457066180608,2019-09-12 20:16:59.877000+00:00,Like drafting is probably the most skill intensive format in magic,
621801347062300701,2019-09-12 20:16:33.650000+00:00,What i mean is theres no way to quanitify it,
621801257635676190,2019-09-12 20:16:12.329000+00:00,I dont think theres a point in measuring pure skill though,
621800989292363818,2019-09-12 20:15:08.351000+00:00,No holden is a modern,
621800948804878336,2019-09-12 20:14:58.698000+00:00,For sure,
621800861915414539,2019-09-12 20:14:37.982000+00:00,Hey ghave is just hard to play,
621800587876630538,2019-09-12 20:13:32.646000+00:00,But i know how to play my decks pretty well,
621800511921717254,2019-09-12 20:13:14.537000+00:00,Also tbh i dont think im particularly good,
621800151534796801,2019-09-12 20:11:48.614000+00:00,Standard pheonix?,
621800115698663444,2019-09-12 20:11:40.070000+00:00,Also neat,
621800046152646664,2019-09-12 20:11:23.489000+00:00,Neat,
621800036610867230,2019-09-12 20:11:21.214000+00:00,Woah,
621799953320116225,2019-09-12 20:11:01.356000+00:00,Bobbys better than u so his opinion is worth more,
621799564516524042,2019-09-12 20:09:28.658000+00:00,Oh yeah sb is pretty big,
621798679182966819,2019-09-12 20:05:57.578000+00:00,because its more fun,
621798661956829185,2019-09-12 20:05:53.471000+00:00,yeah thats why luck is a thing,
621798474538811393,2019-09-12 20:05:08.787000+00:00,but decks are built to be consistant,
621798437591187477,2019-09-12 20:04:59.978000+00:00,i mean yeah,
621798348097323028,2019-09-12 20:04:38.641000+00:00,knowing what hands to keep and when to take risks is part of skill,
621798288924082196,2019-09-12 20:04:24.533000+00:00,especially with the london mull,
621798251859017730,2019-09-12 20:04:15.696000+00:00,not really,
621798076474195979,2019-09-12 20:03:33.881000+00:00,oh mulligining is another big skill,
621797968227336223,2019-09-12 20:03:08.073000+00:00,because yeah standard i would say most decks are you can learn pretty quickly,
621797908685258763,2019-09-12 20:02:53.877000+00:00,yeah but didnt you just play standard?,
621797819522482186,2019-09-12 20:02:32.619000+00:00,how would you know?,
621797808990846976,2019-09-12 20:02:30.108000+00:00,you dont play any formats besides commander,
621797758650679306,2019-09-12 20:02:18.106000+00:00,i mean honestly ray,
621797295192801300,2019-09-12 20:00:27.609000+00:00,which takes a lot longer to learn,
621797274606895135,2019-09-12 20:00:22.701000+00:00,i think it also takes skill to use certain cards like brainstorm and therapy,
621797200829087784,2019-09-12 20:00:05.111000+00:00,others takes a lot longer,
621797181984079872,2019-09-12 20:00:00.618000+00:00,some you can learn in 10,
621797104032940054,2019-09-12 19:59:42.033000+00:00,depends on the deck,
621796857311657985,2019-09-12 19:58:43.210000+00:00,and knowing how to play the deck,
621796839871741952,2019-09-12 19:58:39.052000+00:00,in format knowledge,
621796451831382026,2019-09-12 19:57:06.536000+00:00,when everyone is playing meta decks,
621796427433246730,2019-09-12 19:57:00.719000+00:00,i dont think money matters,
621796138369941535,2019-09-12 19:55:51.801000+00:00,the outcome is dependant on multiple things,
621796115229966356,2019-09-12 19:55:46.284000+00:00,but so is skill,
621796099828744193,2019-09-12 19:55:42.612000+00:00,i mean luck is a factor,
621795868370010112,2019-09-12 19:54:47.428000+00:00,and that doesnt really involve luck,
621795827261898762,2019-09-12 19:54:37.627000+00:00,honestly i think format knowlege is one of the most important factors in being good at magic,
621795530258776065,2019-09-12 19:53:26.816000+00:00,i think it depends on the deck,
621795114993451041,2019-09-12 19:51:47.809000+00:00,and i would say that is a factor in skill,
621795083108352041,2019-09-12 19:51:40.207000+00:00,legacy is a format that heavily rewards knowlege of the format,
621794929718329354,2019-09-12 19:51:03.636000+00:00,even though i dont think its as hard to use as some people make it out to be,
621794873552535553,2019-09-12 19:50:50.245000+00:00,which i would say is a card that requires skill,
621794807865540629,2019-09-12 19:50:34.584000+00:00,and i also play a deck with cabal therapy,

621073719695114250,2019-09-10 20:05:13.767000+00:00,but actually,

620659233087815708,2019-09-09 16:38:12.459000+00:00,If your tutor wins the game it doesent matter,

620658481103503396,2019-09-09 16:35:13.172000+00:00,I thought about equipments too,
620658340392861696,2019-09-09 16:34:39.624000+00:00,Beacuse i can put them in other colors too,
620658285468581908,2019-09-09 16:34:26.529000+00:00,I like humans,
620657816071307284,2019-09-09 16:32:34.616000+00:00,Mb,

620657449082421270,2019-09-09 16:31:07.119000+00:00,But it will be paired with other colors,
620657407093112843,2019-09-09 16:30:57.108000+00:00,You can draft white,
620657342765334541,2019-09-09 16:30:41.771000+00:00,My cube is supposed to be heavy 2 and 3 c,
620657286725107734,2019-09-09 16:30:28.410000+00:00,I could just make W undraftable,
620657117413507115,2019-09-09 16:29:48.043000+00:00,Its probs bad,
620657098937597963,2019-09-09 16:29:43.638000+00:00,Problem is,
620657067576918017,2019-09-09 16:29:36.161000+00:00,Mb i just do ww,
620657019073986561,2019-09-09 16:29:24.597000+00:00,Like rn W is removal and support for other colors,
620656695172923402,2019-09-09 16:28:07.373000+00:00,But i feel like mono w should be viable,
620656614667583518,2019-09-09 16:27:48.179000+00:00,Yeah ill probs do that,
620656483872407609,2019-09-09 16:27:16.995000+00:00,I dont think mono w blink is a thing,
620656432790110218,2019-09-09 16:27:04.816000+00:00,5c,
620656423617036309,2019-09-09 16:27:02.629000+00:00,Yh,
620656357225529354,2019-09-09 16:26:46.800000+00:00,You use UW blinkers,
620656290452078594,2019-09-09 16:26:30.880000+00:00,Etbs,
620656273423204363,2019-09-09 16:26:26.820000+00:00,I mean like,
620656151427678213,2019-09-09 16:25:57.734000+00:00,UW focus,
620656117877571594,2019-09-09 16:25:49.735000+00:00,Blink is more 5c tbh,
620655983449997342,2019-09-09 16:25:17.685000+00:00,Lifegsin is also lame,
620655943440400384,2019-09-09 16:25:08.146000+00:00,Boring,
620655894601924618,2019-09-09 16:24:56.502000+00:00,White weenie tho,
620655861102149663,2019-09-09 16:24:48.515000+00:00,Idk what i can do in white besides like,
620655650753609740,2019-09-09 16:23:58.364000+00:00,And focus more on artifacts,
620655583124520975,2019-09-09 16:23:42.240000+00:00,Ill probs take out storm and super ramp,
620655508595933187,2019-09-09 16:23:24.471000+00:00,I wanna include pox and dredge,
620655176956510209,2019-09-09 16:22:05.402000+00:00,Lol,
620655156643758081,2019-09-09 16:22:00.559000+00:00,I could make a 5c niv one lel,
620655065543344129,2019-09-09 16:21:38.839000+00:00,I realized that rn its basically kust going to be bad vintage cube,
620654987936006146,2019-09-09 16:21:20.336000+00:00,I think i might switch out some of my cube archtypes,
620642812320546818,2019-09-09 15:32:57.443000+00:00,the fact that you can cast this on turn 0 is neat,
620599557340004352,2019-09-09 12:41:04.652000+00:00,Bad,
620453957227118612,2019-09-09 03:02:30.880000+00:00,ill probably be going off existing cubes for lists,
620453928756314123,2019-09-09 03:02:24.092000+00:00,i mean for the combo dekcs like storm and what not,
620453883428208709,2019-09-09 03:02:13.285000+00:00,hmm yeah thats fair,
620453758429691944,2019-09-09 03:01:43.483000+00:00,but i think just making sure i include answers should be a good step towards balance,
620453705761947662,2019-09-09 03:01:30.926000+00:00,ill probably start by testing the combo decks to make sure they're not to busted,
620453597125017610,2019-09-09 03:01:05.025000+00:00,if i can get people to draft it online i'll do that too,
620453502757634068,2019-09-09 03:00:42.526000+00:00,i'll probably be try to play test it,
620450602492624898,2019-09-09 02:49:11.049000+00:00,i can balance in playtesting,
620450504476196874,2019-09-09 02:48:47.680000+00:00,nah im gonna make my cube kinda from scratch,
620450032579117058,2019-09-09 02:46:55.171000+00:00,and im probably going to fill in with a bunch of cube staples,
620449994075406346,2019-09-09 02:46:45.991000+00:00,rn im just making a list of key cards from each archetype,
620449951209619456,2019-09-09 02:46:35.771000+00:00,im probably going to copy a decent amount from other cubes,
620449895886880778,2019-09-09 02:46:22.581000+00:00,k,
620449797429526597,2019-09-09 02:45:59.107000+00:00,as it would synergize with dredge and reanimator,
620449754177863718,2019-09-09 02:45:48.795000+00:00,im thinking about including mill as well,
620449722884423700,2019-09-09 02:45:41.334000+00:00,this is my tenttive plan,
620449704819294208,2019-09-09 02:45:37.027000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/620449704274165761/unknown.png
620449303265280001,2019-09-09 02:44:01.289000+00:00,idk tokens are going to be mainly W,
620449214584979482,2019-09-09 02:43:40.146000+00:00,lol mb,
620449110985670666,2019-09-09 02:43:15.446000+00:00,and i plan on including a lot of gw valuetown style hatebears,
620448996929830927,2019-09-09 02:42:48.253000+00:00,i think the decks like pox and wildfire will help balance out some of the comboy decks,
620448868680859649,2019-09-09 02:42:17.676000+00:00,i think as long as i include appropriate hate it will be fine,
620448758139977738,2019-09-09 02:41:51.321000+00:00,i think tolarion would be fine too,
620448667303936010,2019-09-09 02:41:29.664000+00:00,although it might power super ramp,
620448603743453196,2019-09-09 02:41:14.510000+00:00,i dont think cardle is going to be too good,
620448540002484224,2019-09-09 02:40:59.313000+00:00,and i think including academy and cradle are fine,
620448487938457620,2019-09-09 02:40:46.900000+00:00,hmm yeah fair,
620448461795491862,2019-09-09 02:40:40.667000+00:00,crucible and excavater are gonna be in under the lands category,
620448346238222348,2019-09-09 02:40:13.116000+00:00,idk if strip mine is too good tho,
620448314638467112,2019-09-09 02:40:05.582000+00:00,ill probably try out cards like strip mine as well,
620448163144138772,2019-09-09 02:39:29.463000+00:00,since pox is fairly sac focused,
620448115916275722,2019-09-09 02:39:18.203000+00:00,its looking like there cold def be a mardu aristicrats deck as well,
620448051395297321,2019-09-09 02:39:02.820000+00:00,lol it might go with the pox deck,
620447967580520509,2019-09-09 02:38:42.837000+00:00,like i dont wanna include channel or tinker either,
620447920063512582,2019-09-09 02:38:31.508000+00:00,it kinda just removes some archtyeps,
620447880309899280,2019-09-09 02:38:22.030000+00:00,yeah i dont like power,
620447814262194176,2019-09-09 02:38:06.283000+00:00,yeah its going to take a lot of testing,
620447751909408773,2019-09-09 02:37:51.417000+00:00,im def taking lots of inspiration,
620447711413665825,2019-09-09 02:37:41.762000+00:00,but building one is fun,
620447699388596284,2019-09-09 02:37:38.895000+00:00,i could do that too,
620447601082368030,2019-09-09 02:37:15.457000+00:00,lel,
620447598221983784,2019-09-09 02:37:14.775000+00:00,since i can make every archetype something i would like to draft,
620447554458484747,2019-09-09 02:37:04.341000+00:00,and its fun to make,
620447530643226624,2019-09-09 02:36:58.663000+00:00,yeah i think it would be cool to have,
620447231421710368,2019-09-09 02:35:47.323000+00:00,not bad,
620447186588663808,2019-09-09 02:35:36.634000+00:00,yeah im fine with spending like 50 bucks on sleeves,
620447057538187264,2019-09-09 02:35:05.866000+00:00,yeah i plan on pretty much proxying the whole thing,
620446686950457354,2019-09-09 02:33:37.511000+00:00,and i aint buying all that shit lol,
620446667576967198,2019-09-09 02:33:32.892000+00:00,im building a leagcy/vintage level cube,
620446603110645761,2019-09-09 02:33:17.522000+00:00,i mean im hoping to mainly draft it online tbh,
620446553957728256,2019-09-09 02:33:05.803000+00:00,lol,
620446461053632513,2019-09-09 02:32:43.653000+00:00,and we can draft online,
620446411082694701,2019-09-09 02:32:31.739000+00:00,i probably wont bother putting it in paper until the summer,
620446337133051913,2019-09-09 02:32:14.108000+00:00,it will exist online long before it exists in paper,
620446296855019532,2019-09-09 02:32:04.505000+00:00,i mean this thing aint getting put together in a month lol,
620446182010781697,2019-09-09 02:31:37.124000+00:00,u woudlnt draft my cube :<,
620445641235234866,2019-09-09 02:29:28.193000+00:00,or i could go to like cobblestone some night and see if people wanted to try it out,
620445554194776104,2019-09-09 02:29:07.441000+00:00,"I could probably get 4-6 of Brennar,Ray,you,bobby,holden,jack,jon,carl",
620444309077884939,2019-09-09 02:24:10.582000+00:00,and 4 might be okay,
620444263674806293,2019-09-09 02:23:59.757000+00:00,6 is still pretty good,
620444220376743945,2019-09-09 02:23:49.434000+00:00,and it doesnt need to be 8,
620444161530920976,2019-09-09 02:23:35.404000+00:00,im sure i could force enough people to play it,
620444124390096918,2019-09-09 02:23:26.549000+00:00,...,
620443259029815337,2019-09-09 02:20:00.231000+00:00,ive been playing more on mtgo recetnly and i think they're a lot of fun,
620443200024477746,2019-09-09 02:19:46.163000+00:00,idk i think it would be cool to have one,
620440144117235722,2019-09-09 02:07:37.578000+00:00,theres a decent chance most of those cards end up in my cube,
620437616139173928,2019-09-09 01:57:34.861000+00:00,its just going to be mainly RG,
620437587953451069,2019-09-09 01:57:28.141000+00:00,But im planning on making the lands archetype encompess naya overall,
620437470126800906,2019-09-09 01:57:00.049000+00:00,Armageddon is a card,
620437441253474324,2019-09-09 01:56:53.165000+00:00,although yeah ig ur right,
620437425797464074,2019-09-09 01:56:49.480000+00:00,hmm,
620437370382057483,2019-09-09 01:56:36.268000+00:00,its like a red pox,
620437358096941056,2019-09-09 01:56:33.339000+00:00,idk the wildfire decks is pretty much just an artifact deck that destroys lands on both sides,
620437225330704395,2019-09-09 01:56:01.685000+00:00,"and pox synergiezes with dredge,reanimator, and tokens",
620437174122315818,2019-09-09 01:55:49.476000+00:00,Artifacts is going to be mono Blue,
620437136964845569,2019-09-09 01:55:40.617000+00:00,Well not exactly just one,
620435434404708355,2019-09-09 01:48:54.695000+00:00,since its got synergy with artifact ramp(super ramp) and tutors(reanimator),
620435309175504896,2019-09-09 01:48:24.838000+00:00,but i think storm synergizes better,
620435267815342110,2019-09-09 01:48:14.977000+00:00,i also thought about going for mill for dimir,
620434992937304082,2019-09-09 01:47:09.441000+00:00,<@!300697277503373323> does this seem like a reasonable set of archetypes?,
620434926772289568,2019-09-09 01:46:53.666000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/620434926772289567/unknown.png
620430330637189130,2019-09-09 01:28:37.862000+00:00,same thats why im confused lol,
620430104618598441,2019-09-09 01:27:43.975000+00:00,and then put filler cards that would support generic aggro and control decks?,
620430040265523206,2019-09-09 01:27:28.632000+00:00,should i make my archetypes,
620429796970594324,2019-09-09 01:26:30.626000+00:00,"every deck should either by aggro,control,midrange, or combo",
620429760471760906,2019-09-09 01:26:21.924000+00:00,like those are deck types,
620429732357472275,2019-09-09 01:26:15.221000+00:00,also i dont like how the article lists control and midrange as archetypes,
620429660819292171,2019-09-09 01:25:58.165000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/620429660152528896/unknown.png
620429527960518666,2019-09-09 01:25:26.489000+00:00,its also tought because i want to make sure all of the colors are balanced and what not,
620428958198005770,2019-09-09 01:23:10.647000+00:00,but can also be blue and red,
620428924316418069,2019-09-09 01:23:02.569000+00:00,like reanimator is mainly black,
620428897707622400,2019-09-09 01:22:56.225000+00:00,but things arent super solid,
620428813922467851,2019-09-09 01:22:36.249000+00:00,i mean i was sorting each one by colors orginally,
620428734113251359,2019-09-09 01:22:17.221000+00:00,i mean mb i should reread,
620428606161813507,2019-09-09 01:21:46.715000+00:00,i read that,
620428514746957824,2019-09-09 01:21:24.920000+00:00,i listed the archetypes each one synergies with to the right,
620428440713166858,2019-09-09 01:21:07.269000+00:00,so these are some of the archetypes im interested in supporting,
620428366574649372,2019-09-09 01:20:49.593000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/620428366058881054/unknown.png
620428359394131990,2019-09-09 01:20:47.881000+00:00,so i think going a bit above 360 is good,
620428330491183104,2019-09-09 01:20:40.990000+00:00,but i want some vareriety as well,
620428302993063957,2019-09-09 01:20:34.434000+00:00,360 is the exact amount for an 8 person draft,
620428259502325779,2019-09-09 01:20:24.065000+00:00,yeah i want between 360 and 400,

620427940106338314,2019-09-09 01:19:07.915000+00:00,but idk how to do that,
620427914105716753,2019-09-09 01:19:01.716000+00:00,because there are serveral archetypes i want to support,
620427863472209920,2019-09-09 01:18:49.644000+00:00,im trying to figure out how i want to do things,

619980906278551573,2019-09-07 19:42:46.745000+00:00,but paper is just so much better than online,
619980846119518219,2019-09-07 19:42:32.402000+00:00,if i had a grixis control deck in paper i would probably enjoy playing it,

619980690997510185,2019-09-07 19:41:55.418000+00:00,but theres just something about playing it online that makes it less enjoyable,

619980435975438341,2019-09-07 19:40:54.616000+00:00,"but imagine if you could play modern, legacy, and commander on arena",
619980391163494421,2019-09-07 19:40:43.932000+00:00,like ik it would be alot of work,

618855707055357963,2019-09-04 17:11:38.345000+00:00,lol honestly brennar that deck has been putting up results for a while now,
618855540172259339,2019-09-04 17:10:58.557000+00:00,amulet titan looks more fun than storm to me,
618855504709550090,2019-09-04 17:10:50.102000+00:00,ive actually heard that 5c niv mizzet is kinda viable,
618855459675439125,2019-09-04 17:10:39.365000+00:00,do it,
618855440372989985,2019-09-04 17:10:34.763000+00:00,amulet titan is what you're looking for,
618855415832379392,2019-09-04 17:10:28.912000+00:00,also if you want big brain hard to play decks,
618855348752744467,2019-09-04 17:10:12.919000+00:00,and i think theres skill to it,
618855320457969677,2019-09-04 17:10:06.173000+00:00,that deck seems pretty tempoy,
618855289713721354,2019-09-04 17:09:58.843000+00:00,you might like gds,
618855145882779649,2019-09-04 17:09:24.551000+00:00,holden would let you try it out,
618854775546445834,2019-09-04 17:07:56.256000+00:00,are there any other modern decks that have interested you?,
618854744710184992,2019-09-04 17:07:48.904000+00:00,although i mean if burn is your fave deck then go for it,
618854674283626497,2019-09-04 17:07:32.113000+00:00,like to me burn is a really good deck to just have a budget version of,
618854570545905674,2019-09-04 17:07:07.380000+00:00,although that migth be a bit worse with sfm,
618854529248788488,2019-09-04 17:06:57.534000+00:00,and you could always just shift into mono red prowess,
618854494750375936,2019-09-04 17:06:49.309000+00:00,like you dont need gobin guys that much to do well,
618854450081169423,2019-09-04 17:06:38.659000+00:00,honestly brennar i think you should just build a diffrent deck and keep burn as is,
618853986199404574,2019-09-04 17:04:48.061000+00:00,but there are probably decks you would enjoy playing more than something super linear like burn,
618853900249727034,2019-09-04 17:04:27.569000+00:00,no offense to burn,
618853879009771520,2019-09-04 17:04:22.505000+00:00,you should build another deck besides burn,
618853843429490717,2019-09-04 17:04:14.022000+00:00,just have self control lol,
618853268428161044,2019-09-04 17:01:56.931000+00:00,you would do good,
618853251420520508,2019-09-04 17:01:52.876000+00:00,lol brennar you know enough about the modern meta you should just play,
618853197355679766,2019-09-04 17:01:39.986000+00:00,<@!242014433365196810> lingering souls ;),
618852777468231731,2019-09-04 16:59:59.877000+00:00,We'll see what happens,
618852670681120778,2019-09-04 16:59:34.417000+00:00,I feel like that should be a deck,
618852331030577153,2019-09-04 16:58:13.438000+00:00,Which is a good thing,
618852283664433169,2019-09-04 16:58:02.145000+00:00,Honestly sfm hasnt impressed me too much so far,
618852167096205320,2019-09-04 16:57:34.353000+00:00,Koa seems real good rn,

618852087437983757,2019-09-04 16:57:15.361000+00:00,Kill wurmcoil or a map,
618851992483397642,2019-09-04 16:56:52.722000+00:00,Its also fine vs tron,
618851958974840832,2019-09-04 16:56:44.733000+00:00,Unless ur meta is all sfm and whirza,
618851879983775744,2019-09-04 16:56:25.900000+00:00,No,
618851851156324362,2019-09-04 16:56:19.027000+00:00,Yh,
618851756691947520,2019-09-04 16:55:56.505000+00:00,Unless thats not modern legal,
618851710588289039,2019-09-04 16:55:45.513000+00:00,I mean snash to smithereens for burn mb,
618851646503649361,2019-09-04 16:55:30.234000+00:00,Yh,
618851599338438677,2019-09-04 16:55:18.989000+00:00,So u steel need a good clock to beat it,
618851529062875136,2019-09-04 16:55:02.234000+00:00,Problem is whirza is recirsive,
618851462511853568,2019-09-04 16:54:46.367000+00:00,K command is maindeckable 2,
618851399144570895,2019-09-04 16:54:31.259000+00:00,I think people are going to be playing more haye die to sfm,
618851233976811520,2019-09-04 16:53:51.880000+00:00,We'll see though,
618851187554385931,2019-09-04 16:53:40.812000+00:00,Theres enough,
618850922704928815,2019-09-04 16:52:37.667000+00:00,Its a powerful deck,
618850646686302208,2019-09-04 16:51:31.859000+00:00,Yh i could see it,
618850057281601537,2019-09-04 16:49:11.334000+00:00,yeah,
618850034368118797,2019-09-04 16:49:05.871000+00:00,but we'll see how the meta shakes up,
618850013522690068,2019-09-04 16:49:00.901000+00:00,rn i think im going to make some sort of deaths shadow varient,
618849862225625098,2019-09-04 16:48:24.829000+00:00,but u can just bolt sfm,
618849840759177230,2019-09-04 16:48:19.711000+00:00,and batterskull probably suck for you,
618849811214499870,2019-09-04 16:48:12.667000+00:00,it will get worse over time,
618849790872125451,2019-09-04 16:48:07.817000+00:00,since the meta is all shaking,
618849770018045971,2019-09-04 16:48:02.845000+00:00,burn is good rn in modern,
618849746131484702,2019-09-04 16:47:57.150000+00:00,deaths shadow is a pretty sweet deck,
618849556859322380,2019-09-04 16:47:12.024000+00:00,you can do those and standard at the same time,
618849530670088192,2019-09-04 16:47:05.780000+00:00,anyway i dont get why u dont play modern or legacy,
618849456498016286,2019-09-04 16:46:48.096000+00:00,lol more than slightly,
618849324494880788,2019-09-04 16:46:16.624000+00:00,yeah fuck tron,
618849247781191709,2019-09-04 16:45:58.334000+00:00,and its super heavy on interaction,
618849193544384522,2019-09-04 16:45:45.403000+00:00,its just playing really good cards in each slot,
618849160510308372,2019-09-04 16:45:37.527000+00:00,cuz jund is a midrange deck,
618849020403646465,2019-09-04 16:45:04.123000+00:00,brennar stop trigerring holden,
618848530144034817,2019-09-04 16:43:07.236000+00:00,yeah storm would be trash if it were that simple,
618848438754213898,2019-09-04 16:42:45.447000+00:00,lol,
618848370152439840,2019-09-04 16:42:29.091000+00:00,the closest thing to a stompy deck in legacy is moon stompy,
618848211498565634,2019-09-04 16:41:51.265000+00:00,u'd probs like it,
618848195363209245,2019-09-04 16:41:47.418000+00:00,brennar u should try out legacy delver,
618848151113039882,2019-09-04 16:41:36.868000+00:00,i mean its like delver,
618847879762542593,2019-09-04 16:40:32.173000+00:00,that deck seems a bit skill intensive,
618847648883015680,2019-09-04 16:39:37.127000+00:00,so i cant say anymore on that,
618847628691636264,2019-09-04 16:39:32.313000+00:00,modern was p linear but it might be less so now,
618847594189160479,2019-09-04 16:39:24.087000+00:00,just that something legacy is more so,
618847550358683658,2019-09-04 16:39:13.637000+00:00,im not saying its not,
618847503697313792,2019-09-04 16:39:02.512000+00:00,and you have to have ways of dealing with them,
618847476450983936,2019-09-04 16:38:56.016000+00:00,you have to play around instant wins,
618847453487169577,2019-09-04 16:38:50.541000+00:00,yeah but thats what makes a format like legacy exciting and skill intensive,
618847210934894642,2019-09-04 16:37:52.712000+00:00,well it depends on the card,
618847186834161678,2019-09-04 16:37:46.966000+00:00,lol yeah,
618847004474343445,2019-09-04 16:37:03.488000+00:00,yeah but they are week in the scheme of most other formats,
618846925445398578,2019-09-04 16:36:44.646000+00:00,so?,
618846878850744331,2019-09-04 16:36:33.537000+00:00,and modern cards arent op in modern,
618846859234115614,2019-09-04 16:36:28.860000+00:00,legacy cards arent op in legacy,
618846755655647243,2019-09-04 16:36:04.165000+00:00,unless its a format like limited where its like a puzzel,
618846701028900864,2019-09-04 16:35:51.141000+00:00,playing with weak cards just isnt as fun though,
618846660356997151,2019-09-04 16:35:41.444000+00:00,gj,
618846495491358741,2019-09-04 16:35:02.137000+00:00,that tier 2 thing is also true of modern and legacy,
618846394173751316,2019-09-04 16:34:37.981000+00:00,^,
618846355028181012,2019-09-04 16:34:28.648000+00:00,and playing with powerful cards is just fun,
618846152489435158,2019-09-04 16:33:40.359000+00:00,formats like modern and legacy have a wide range of viable decks,
618846101436628992,2019-09-04 16:33:28.187000+00:00,standard also just gets solved really fast,
618845881621413891,2019-09-04 16:32:35.779000+00:00,drafting is fun,
618845868283527188,2019-09-04 16:32:32.599000+00:00,but thats what limited is for,
618845828626251797,2019-09-04 16:32:23.144000+00:00,yeah like i get wanting to play slow,
618845663064621092,2019-09-04 16:31:43.671000+00:00,without the fun of drafting,
618845632899317761,2019-09-04 16:31:36.479000+00:00,standard is basically a limited power level,
618845595729133588,2019-09-04 16:31:27.617000+00:00,lol how is that more boring than standard,
618845410076917775,2019-09-04 16:30:43.354000+00:00,yeah that doesnt make it seem any less annoying lol,
618845364128317460,2019-09-04 16:30:32.399000+00:00,"im fine with just looking for modern,legacy, and commander cards during spoiler season",
618845273027772446,2019-09-04 16:30:10.679000+00:00,power level and rotation,
618844644582752266,2019-09-04 16:27:40.846000+00:00,Its lame,
618844612261576704,2019-09-04 16:27:33.140000+00:00,But idc about standard,

618836959158337577,2019-09-04 15:57:08.498000+00:00,pie wrap seems like a decent limited card,
618836754346016768,2019-09-04 15:56:19.667000+00:00,okay thats a bit better than i thought,

618214443788009481,2019-09-02 22:43:29.268000+00:00,true name is part of why merfolk is playable in legacy,
618214356487766036,2019-09-02 22:43:08.454000+00:00,its no where near as playable now,
618214288418668594,2019-09-02 22:42:52.225000+00:00,but its worse now that plague engineer is a thing,
618214249269035028,2019-09-02 22:42:42.891000+00:00,yeah true name kinda sucks,
618213393249206275,2019-09-02 22:39:18.800000+00:00,until you actually have to play against it,
618213368804933673,2019-09-02 22:39:12.972000+00:00,i feel like jitte is one of those card where it doesnt seem as good,
618213292724322308,2019-09-02 22:38:54.833000+00:00,they dont really print good equipment so it should be fine,
618213235065094167,2019-09-02 22:38:41.086000+00:00,yh,
618213183467028493,2019-09-02 22:38:28.784000+00:00,if jitte were unbanned it would be a diffrent story,
618213133760200737,2019-09-02 22:38:16.933000+00:00,i def dont think the card is too good rn,

618211197400907776,2019-09-02 22:30:35.269000+00:00,hopefully more to come,
618211186311430147,2019-09-02 22:30:32.625000+00:00,so its on their mind,
618211162882048021,2019-09-02 22:30:27.039000+00:00,they printed a decent zombie tribal card in horizons,
618210927166226442,2019-09-02 22:29:30.840000+00:00,lol modern hogaak lists with dual lands have been popping up in 5-0s and challenges recently,
618210750917378060,2019-09-02 22:28:48.819000+00:00,sitichers supplier becomes an ancestreal recall on steroids,
618210703915876403,2019-09-02 22:28:37.613000+00:00,like part of the reason hogaak was so good is because you could just mill yourself and just play it,
618210586077036560,2019-09-02 22:28:09.518000+00:00,or even just a big boi gravecrawler,
618210533279137809,2019-09-02 22:27:56.930000+00:00,i could see it becoming a deck,
618210512764796931,2019-09-02 22:27:52.039000+00:00,like if they printed something like hogaak that was zombie specific,
618210461774512161,2019-09-02 22:27:39.882000+00:00,yeah and its too slow for its lack of threats,
618210092625690634,2019-09-02 22:26:11.870000+00:00,i'd probs play zombies if it was good,
618209772591644692,2019-09-02 22:24:55.568000+00:00,that also happen to involve the graveyard,
618209697912193071,2019-09-02 22:24:37.763000+00:00,i like fast creature based decks,

617861222452297731,2019-09-01 23:19:54.739000+00:00,i think the closest thing to a good deck ive liked is mardu shadow,

615597728025542721,2019-08-26 17:25:35.614000+00:00,Yh,
615597684790919225,2019-08-26 17:25:25.306000+00:00,Without fast combo it has a chance,
615597592545460234,2019-08-26 17:25:03.313000+00:00,If ponza becomes playable im doing that tho,
615597528217419789,2019-08-26 17:24:47.976000+00:00,Fair enough,
615597304925126707,2019-08-26 17:23:54.739000+00:00,And is not very red,
615597235542949990,2019-08-26 17:23:38.197000+00:00,Jund runs a lot of non basics,
615597122439479305,2019-08-26 17:23:11.231000+00:00,It can also rn grudges for whirza,
615597021381918721,2019-08-26 17:22:47.137000+00:00,Its good against tron and jund,
615596932114415656,2019-08-26 17:22:25.854000+00:00,But its a good sign,
615596906046816296,2019-08-26 17:22:19.639000+00:00,I mean yh,
615596821305098282,2019-08-26 17:21:59.435000+00:00,A less red format means a better blood moon,
615596770352693288,2019-08-26 17:21:47.287000+00:00,I think ponza gets better too,
615596717215318018,2019-08-26 17:21:34.618000+00:00,I think dnt will be a deck,

615595720371732499,2019-08-26 17:17:36.952000+00:00,No telling what happens now,
615595686121046037,2019-08-26 17:17:28.786000+00:00,It will be cool to see how the format shakes out,

615571036808806455,2019-08-26 15:39:31.932000+00:00,and it seems like a deck that you'd want to get a decent amount of practice in,
615570910124179456,2019-08-26 15:39:01.728000+00:00,since its 700tix,

615569060184195086,2019-08-26 15:31:40.668000+00:00,which is possible with the slower meta,

609175345748246528,2019-08-09 00:05:20.357000+00:00,and the fact that it gives the opponent options weakens it a bit,
609175230761533440,2019-08-09 00:04:52.942000+00:00,those are instants tho,
609174696596078593,2019-08-09 00:02:45.587000+00:00,that card just seems so weak that im skeptical,

609164822365601802,2019-08-08 23:23:31.387000+00:00,which hasnt been doing much recently and i can imagine even that deck wanting to run this,

608094649143263252,2019-08-06 00:31:02.208000+00:00,lol,
608094273115521024,2019-08-06 00:29:32.556000+00:00,drop by around like 3 or 4,
608094229859926018,2019-08-06 00:29:22.243000+00:00,so if you want to get some playtesting/legacy in,
608094191616262145,2019-08-06 00:29:13.125000+00:00,ill probs be at cobbelstone pretty early,
608094152475017255,2019-08-06 00:29:03.793000+00:00,lol,
608094007154966539,2019-08-06 00:28:29.146000+00:00,the only thing keeping me from casting it is a leyline or a rip,
608093968810508309,2019-08-06 00:28:20.004000+00:00,because if i have a gaak in hand,
608093949898260501,2019-08-06 00:28:15.495000+00:00,thats why stuff like grafdiggers cage is sometimes usless,
608093894483116032,2019-08-06 00:28:02.283000+00:00,yeah,
608093844218839041,2019-08-06 00:27:50.299000+00:00,so you cant respond to me casting gaak,
608093816414535680,2019-08-06 00:27:43.670000+00:00,yup,
608093799004110876,2019-08-06 00:27:39.519000+00:00,like i'll even ditch lands that i might need if it means keeping my gaak from touching the yard on the risk of a surgical,
608093605885771857,2019-08-06 00:26:53.476000+00:00,so that you dont get a chance to surgical every time,
608093565381378070,2019-08-06 00:26:43.819000+00:00,and then just cast it from the hand,
608093548432326666,2019-08-06 00:26:39.778000+00:00,is most gaak players will avoid putting gaak in the yard if they can help it,
608093501254664192,2019-08-06 00:26:28.530000+00:00,the problem with surgical,
608093485282754576,2019-08-06 00:26:24.722000+00:00,just so you have a decent way of getting rid of a gaak,
608093438587568138,2019-08-06 00:26:13.589000+00:00,i would at least consider maiining a path or 2,
608093271813652482,2019-08-06 00:25:33.827000+00:00,yeah,
608093221511495700,2019-08-06 00:25:21.834000+00:00,like theres no best version,
608093202678939648,2019-08-06 00:25:17.344000+00:00,i think pyro is just one of those decks where you can change a lot with the lists,
608093115018117130,2019-08-06 00:24:56.444000+00:00,play,
608093109217132570,2019-08-06 00:24:55.061000+00:00,ditch kamabl then unearth it seems like a sweet lay,
608092885920776192,2019-08-06 00:24:01.823000+00:00,i need some more practice with modern gaak anyway,
608092853255667747,2019-08-06 00:23:54.035000+00:00,we should do some play testing,
608092781008912404,2019-08-06 00:23:36.810000+00:00,but thats not always the best against gaak,
608092743385743431,2019-08-06 00:23:27.840000+00:00,or chump/bolt enough,
608092714415947796,2019-08-06 00:23:20.933000+00:00,like you'd just have to dreadbore,
608092672506200064,2019-08-06 00:23:10.941000+00:00,yeah i mean your list has trouble dealing with a resolved gaak,
608092512577650698,2019-08-06 00:22:32.811000+00:00,plauge is a pain if you can get it down fast enough,
608092434248892416,2019-08-06 00:22:14.136000+00:00,although honestly with leylines and the plauge bois u have a decent sb against gaak to begin with,
608092373792325633,2019-08-06 00:21:59.722000+00:00,its good against the gaak,
608092352300449831,2019-08-06 00:21:54.598000+00:00,have you thought about adding path as well?,
608092114462441472,2019-08-06 00:20:57.893000+00:00,oh fair,
608092088449499157,2019-08-06 00:20:51.691000+00:00,i guess tap out on turn 2 is kinda bad for it,
608092044040339474,2019-08-06 00:20:41.103000+00:00,oh really?,
608092035693412362,2019-08-06 00:20:39.113000+00:00,that card seems like it could be sweet in pyros,
608092003871490058,2019-08-06 00:20:31.526000+00:00,oh bobby have u tried out dreadhorde arcanist?,

608091701147336714,2019-08-06 00:19:19.351000+00:00,especially since thats mb,
608091668985413651,2019-08-06 00:19:11.683000+00:00,i gues having k command is nice against it,
608091613885104159,2019-08-06 00:18:58.546000+00:00,<@190915778042789888> how do u beat grixis whirza,

608081060076584960,2019-08-05 23:37:02.322000+00:00,stitchers is the most powerful enabler in the deck,
608080976672981003,2019-08-05 23:36:42.437000+00:00,i mean if they ban any non gaak non looting card it would be stitchers,
608080924600434698,2019-08-05 23:36:30.022000+00:00,god it would be so fucking funny,

608080832476741633,2019-08-05 23:36:08.058000+00:00,maybe they'll just ban saytrs wayfinder instead,
608080564720762880,2019-08-05 23:35:04.220000+00:00,nou,

608080033336131596,2019-08-05 23:32:57.528000+00:00,i kind of like how legacy is more stable,
608079997797924864,2019-08-05 23:32:49.055000+00:00,i guess ill just have to see how the meta shifts after the gaak ban,
608079822417035285,2019-08-05 23:32:07.241000+00:00,no u,

608079367364673566,2019-08-05 23:30:18.748000+00:00,i wouldnt mind building mono red pheonix,
608079148572868631,2019-08-05 23:29:26.584000+00:00,but they're not gonna unban bridge,
608079125902655525,2019-08-05 23:29:21.179000+00:00,i would be okay with hogaak getting banned if i could play bridgevine,
608078898453807104,2019-08-05 23:28:26.951000+00:00,hey bridgevine was an okay deck,
608078804191150100,2019-08-05 23:28:04.477000+00:00,but its probably not gonna have a home after the gaak ban,
608078757995216932,2019-08-05 23:27:53.463000+00:00,i wish i could still jam vengevine,

608078372148477953,2019-08-05 23:26:21.470000+00:00,the problem is its probably not very good,

608076353505460369,2019-08-05 23:18:20.188000+00:00,but the only decks that would be less than 2 hundo to move to are,

608076094230364164,2019-08-05 23:17:18.372000+00:00,i guess i could sell the grull stuff for something else tho,
608076020427522060,2019-08-05 23:17:00.776000+00:00,and im not giving up legacy gaak,
608075993823051806,2019-08-05 23:16:54.433000+00:00,since thats what i have,
608075977880240130,2019-08-05 23:16:50.632000+00:00,i need something with the jund mana base,

605881161335701504,2019-07-30 21:55:25.590000+00:00,between the bolts and the playmat is like 50 dollars worth of value,
605881120394969088,2019-07-30 21:55:15.829000+00:00,honestly the fanatic packages seems like a great deal,
605880961636237322,2019-07-30 21:54:37.978000+00:00,Ben was busy so we'll probbaly get it figured out tonight or tommorow,
605880904682045490,2019-07-30 21:54:24.399000+00:00,there are some pretty close to where ur staying and are pretty much on the way,
605880855470276638,2019-07-30 21:54:12.666000+00:00,we were looking around,
605880750826323999,2019-07-30 21:53:47.717000+00:00,still not bad,
605880738239348748,2019-07-30 21:53:44.716000+00:00,but the 2 are non foil,
605880697198215180,2019-07-30 21:53:34.931000+00:00,and 2 from the double ups,
605880684413976636,2019-07-30 21:53:31.883000+00:00,yeah i got one foil from the package,
605880601211437058,2019-07-30 21:53:12.046000+00:00,and i already have fetches,
605880565056536590,2019-07-30 21:53:03.426000+00:00,so its like a 2 for 1,
605880537248301163,2019-07-30 21:52:56.796000+00:00,since if u build modern burn u also basically get legacy burn,
605880478049894403,2019-07-30 21:52:42.682000+00:00,but im building a burn deck,

605878342775734338,2019-07-30 21:44:13.593000+00:00,promo lands look fine,
605877406774984851,2019-07-30 21:40:30.433000+00:00,so i might just end up with 3 promo bolts lol,

604455301260902441,2019-07-26 23:29:34.057000+00:00,he started to focus more on streaming for entertainment as opposed to trophys,
604445550133379092,2019-07-26 22:50:49.207000+00:00,ill take solice in the fact that the guy that beat me used to be one of the top trophy leaders in legacy modo,
604445365369831467,2019-07-26 22:50:05.156000+00:00,but that would have been kind of scummy,
604445330213175315,2019-07-26 22:49:56.774000+00:00,and i probably would have won if i had cabal therapyed based off taht,
604445271199449167,2019-07-26 22:49:42.704000+00:00,i mean i did,
604441664550862857,2019-07-26 22:35:22.812000+00:00,yeah the legacy streaming community is small,
604441551367831552,2019-07-26 22:34:55.827000+00:00,i mean he had 100 viewers,
604440697189433344,2019-07-26 22:31:32.175000+00:00,game 2 he just burned me out,

604432039361511445,2019-07-26 21:57:07.988000+00:00,cuz lets be honest karmic guide being a pro black 2/2 is hardly the strongest aprt of it,
604431878157762626,2019-07-26 21:56:29.554000+00:00,and no one mentions it,

603745649904582657,2019-07-25 00:29:39.989000+00:00,yeah im with robbs,
603744956431204374,2019-07-25 00:26:54.652000+00:00,it was like a one card combo with multiple cards,
603744818983600130,2019-07-25 00:26:21.882000+00:00,yeah bobbys first draft was op af,
603736869716623430,2019-07-24 23:54:46.629000+00:00,"Whenever Darius is dealt damage, instead prevent that damage and put that many +1/+1 counters on him",
603736415980879904,2019-07-24 23:52:58.450000+00:00,to darius,
603736408200314880,2019-07-24 23:52:56.595000+00:00,"if darius would take damage, instead prevent that damage and add that many +1/+1 counters",
603735976337997844,2019-07-24 23:51:13.631000+00:00,i mean thats less than what jack had,
603734746702544896,2019-07-24 23:46:20.463000+00:00,cuz its not great,
603734737147658271,2019-07-24 23:46:18.185000+00:00,yeah but hopefully he will fix the wording,
603734489650167808,2019-07-24 23:45:19.177000+00:00,honestly just the fact that there are so many lines makes it look jarring,
603734393860653079,2019-07-24 23:44:56.339000+00:00,yeah darius needs less words,
603733840300867585,2019-07-24 23:42:44.360000+00:00,hmm interesting,
603733361500094484,2019-07-24 23:40:50.205000+00:00,ill make him a 1/5,
603733335902257192,2019-07-24 23:40:44.102000+00:00,hmm,
603733172554956873,2019-07-24 23:40:05.157000+00:00,and i don think it matters so a 2/5 he stays,
603733137490444298,2019-07-24 23:39:56.797000+00:00,idk y but i think 2/5 looks better than 1/5,
603732750511505408,2019-07-24 23:38:24.534000+00:00,yeah deathtouch is on theme,
603732694664216576,2019-07-24 23:38:11.219000+00:00,true,
603732585159589899,2019-07-24 23:37:45.111000+00:00,the plan is to sacc him anyway,
603732559838576650,2019-07-24 23:37:39.074000+00:00,i mean idk,
603732450840936473,2019-07-24 23:37:13.087000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/603732450065121281/unknown.png
603731741596712978,2019-07-24 23:34:23.990000+00:00,is just giving him indestructible too good?,
603731705454526464,2019-07-24 23:34:15.373000+00:00,also now that i have room i think some sort of ability relating to it being god would be nice,
603731341368098816,2019-07-24 23:32:48.568000+00:00,it would just be me adding an extra color because it makes the commander better,
603731276008128532,2019-07-24 23:32:32.985000+00:00,honestly i dont think i can justify red as is rn,
603731243414192206,2019-07-24 23:32:25.214000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/603731243397414946/unknown.png

603730645188870271,2019-07-24 23:30:02.586000+00:00,what if i just kept it simple,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/603730645188870165/unknown.png
603730369115717641,2019-07-24 23:28:56.765000+00:00,i should probably just make it orzhove,
603730339306668033,2019-07-24 23:28:49.658000+00:00,honestly i think mine is kind of a mess too tbh,
603730224038805514,2019-07-24 23:28:22.176000+00:00,mine is everything ray hates about me is a magic player,
603730000973398027,2019-07-24 23:27:28.993000+00:00,the most balanced is brennars,
603729932949913610,2019-07-24 23:27:12.775000+00:00,i disagree,
603729430321299479,2019-07-24 23:25:12.939000+00:00,robby i think urs is the least wordy one so far,
603729310964252692,2019-07-24 23:24:44.482000+00:00,lol i like how all of our commanders are wordy,
603728731206320139,2019-07-24 23:22:26.257000+00:00,just so its easier to find them without scrolling,
603728692681900032,2019-07-24 23:22:17.072000+00:00,i made another channel for the custom commanders btw,
603727877330042921,2019-07-24 23:19:02.677000+00:00,i mean yeah but you need to nerf him somehow,
603727829040889876,2019-07-24 23:18:51.164000+00:00,yeah that could work,
603727708626616339,2019-07-24 23:18:22.455000+00:00,hmm,
603727699021660165,2019-07-24 23:18:20.165000+00:00,oh wait hexproof still makes him strong,
603727576610897920,2019-07-24 23:17:50.980000+00:00,if you made him like 4 mana and dropped emminacne that would be better,
603727495048593440,2019-07-24 23:17:31.534000+00:00,pretty much,
603727419563573259,2019-07-24 23:17:13.537000+00:00,if you made it 10 mana it would be strong,
603727386303004693,2019-07-24 23:17:05.607000+00:00,cuz the reason its strong is emminance,
603727361476657162,2019-07-24 23:16:59.688000+00:00,nah,
603727301972328455,2019-07-24 23:16:45.501000+00:00,i mean it def looks better jeskai,
603727231755354113,2019-07-24 23:16:28.760000+00:00,this feels more borosy to me any,
603727120983916544,2019-07-24 23:16:02.350000+00:00,if you lose blue that might balance it,
603727088557752321,2019-07-24 23:15:54.619000+00:00,honestly bobby,
603727004134670397,2019-07-24 23:15:34.491000+00:00,oh bobby can still die to commander damage,
603726867190644764,2019-07-24 23:15:01.841000+00:00,cuz he's great,
603726857564585994,2019-07-24 23:14:59.546000+00:00,i was being sarcastic,
603726711670177792,2019-07-24 23:14:24.762000+00:00,lol he bad nvm,
603726697153560600,2019-07-24 23:14:21.301000+00:00,oh u right,
603726610385862667,2019-07-24 23:14:00.614000+00:00,who woulda thunk,
603726552290689054,2019-07-24 23:13:46.763000+00:00,emminance might just be too good,
603726531889463306,2019-07-24 23:13:41.899000+00:00,yeah bobby is kinda unkillable against some decks,
603726428479160340,2019-07-24 23:13:17.244000+00:00,hmm,
603726260056883230,2019-07-24 23:12:37.089000+00:00,it gets rid of the comboey aspect,
603726202779205657,2019-07-24 23:12:23.433000+00:00,yeah this is still good,
603726189005373460,2019-07-24 23:12:20.149000+00:00,i see,
603726181874794546,2019-07-24 23:12:18.449000+00:00,oh ok,
603726097112105011,2019-07-24 23:11:58.240000+00:00,is this just bad now?,
603726081563820042,2019-07-24 23:11:54.533000+00:00,hmm,
603725935015100436,2019-07-24 23:11:19.593000+00:00,bobby you either need to get rid of eminance or nerf the ability,
603725786813562921,2019-07-24 23:10:44.259000+00:00,this is basically 0 in jeskai,
603725761618116620,2019-07-24 23:10:38.252000+00:00,original was 6 mana in mono white,
603725688306008094,2019-07-24 23:10:20.773000+00:00,yeah honestly robby you have a point,
603725180078129193,2019-07-24 23:08:19.602000+00:00,idk robby,
603724911780954113,2019-07-24 23:07:15.635000+00:00,but at least this way its not as easy to break,
603724882441928753,2019-07-24 23:07:08.640000+00:00,you could still break it by giving them haste,
603724641906851841,2019-07-24 23:06:11.292000+00:00,or i mean they cant tap the turn they come out,
603724601352257536,2019-07-24 23:06:01.623000+00:00,so they cant go at instant speed,
603724578061287425,2019-07-24 23:05:56.070000+00:00,or you could make it so the soldiers have the tap ability,
603724486101041166,2019-07-24 23:05:34.145000+00:00,and infinite with a sould warden out,
603724183788060676,2019-07-24 23:04:22.068000+00:00,with like 10 combo pieces,
603724158119182340,2019-07-24 23:04:15.948000+00:00,literally a one card combo,
603724140792381440,2019-07-24 23:04:11.817000+00:00,yeah thats way too easy to make infinite soldiers,
603724017739890689,2019-07-24 23:03:42.479000+00:00,does this seem too wordy,
603724003017752601,2019-07-24 23:03:38.969000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/603724003017752597/unknown.png
603723260021964800,2019-07-24 23:00:41.825000+00:00,i might do that,
603723145207349298,2019-07-24 23:00:14.451000+00:00,eeehhhh,
603723134704680960,2019-07-24 23:00:11.947000+00:00,is sac a red ability tho?,
603723083605606408,2019-07-24 22:59:59.764000+00:00,and that wasnt really a red ability,
603723056174858240,2019-07-24 22:59:53.224000+00:00,i just changed it cuz i wanted red,
603722750963744778,2019-07-24 22:58:40.456000+00:00,changed the activated ability,
603722707951026235,2019-07-24 22:58:30.201000+00:00,does this seem fair?,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/603722707951026225/unknown.png
603720462962393108,2019-07-24 22:49:34.954000+00:00,seems busted tho,
603720446025924619,2019-07-24 22:49:30.916000+00:00,i love it,
603719857598365726,2019-07-24 22:47:10.624000+00:00,that would make sense,
603719616132415489,2019-07-24 22:46:13.054000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/603719616132415488/unknown.png
603719485563600901,2019-07-24 22:45:41.924000+00:00,yeah i just missed that on the zombies,
603719289458917426,2019-07-24 22:44:55.169000+00:00,thats the plan,
603719197226303557,2019-07-24 22:44:33.179000+00:00,thats 120 life,
603719163185332244,2019-07-24 22:44:25.063000+00:00,i dont think its op,
603719143522304002,2019-07-24 22:44:20.375000+00:00,but out of 3 other players,
603719119325495298,2019-07-24 22:44:14.606000+00:00,i mean yeah,
603719041651310593,2019-07-24 22:43:56.087000+00:00,2 life isnt much in commander,
603719023150104653,2019-07-24 22:43:51.676000+00:00,not really,
603718731054448651,2019-07-24 22:42:42.035000+00:00,which is very important,
603718712427544611,2019-07-24 22:42:37.594000+00:00,in that it says target player,
603718679305257002,2019-07-24 22:42:29.697000+00:00,actually theres a key diffrence that makes athreos better,
603718567162282024,2019-07-24 22:42:02.960000+00:00,yeah ill put it down to 2 life,
603718433850392597,2019-07-24 22:41:31.176000+00:00,oof i wasnt even thinking about athreos lol,
603718334424285195,2019-07-24 22:41:07.471000+00:00,honestly i think 2 is fine,
603718287121186836,2019-07-24 22:40:56.193000+00:00,and any player can do that,
603718262068477962,2019-07-24 22:40:50.220000+00:00,but you can pay 4 life to stop it,
603718218049257503,2019-07-24 22:40:39.725000+00:00,yes,
603717937676812288,2019-07-24 22:39:32.879000+00:00,hey but its also triple black,
603717787331854337,2019-07-24 22:38:57.034000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/603717787331854336/unknown.png
603716791528587279,2019-07-24 22:34:59.616000+00:00,yeah but it also gave me an excuse to make it mardu,
603716553631858729,2019-07-24 22:34:02.897000+00:00,it was better when it was adding counters to the other ability,
603716512548913155,2019-07-24 22:33:53.102000+00:00,mb,
603716331476615169,2019-07-24 22:33:09.931000+00:00,since it gives people the option to just lose 2 life instead,
603716283996962816,2019-07-24 22:32:58.611000+00:00,mine is actually less comboy than bfb,
603715737831342129,2019-07-24 22:30:48.395000+00:00,robbys is more comboie than mine,
603715662262697985,2019-07-24 22:30:30.378000+00:00,this isnt,
603715456259457035,2019-07-24 22:29:41.263000+00:00,but i like the other ability,
603715430154108971,2019-07-24 22:29:35.039000+00:00,i mean this is more reasonable text wise,

603705734873743372,2019-07-24 21:51:03.504000+00:00,i mean we can still do that,

603705564392062976,2019-07-24 21:50:22.858000+00:00,are you guys all making decks for your commanders?,
603705369146949653,2019-07-24 21:49:36.308000+00:00,i think one thing that can be said for all of these commanders is that they need to be tested to see how strong they actually are,
603705186912829647,2019-07-24 21:48:52.860000+00:00,honestly even 5 would still be fine i think,
603705049750700061,2019-07-24 21:48:20.158000+00:00,past in flames,
603704938001989654,2019-07-24 21:47:53.515000+00:00,the fact that you can make treausre in other ways also makes the exile affect strong,
603704804505550871,2019-07-24 21:47:21.687000+00:00,yeah i think making it creatures makes this less of a storm commander,
603704449105526809,2019-07-24 21:45:56.953000+00:00,ha get rekt nerds,
603704169907617804,2019-07-24 21:44:50.387000+00:00,as the permier combo player of the group i think i have the authority,
603703941728829462,2019-07-24 21:43:55.985000+00:00,robby this is a combo commander,
603703864050450432,2019-07-24 21:43:37.465000+00:00,anything that makes mana like that has the potential to be broken,
603703779090628624,2019-07-24 21:43:17.209000+00:00,your commander is probably the most combotastic one thats been posted so far,

598973582672003081,2019-07-11 20:27:10.500000+00:00,But i thi k legacy is just the beyter format in terms of quality of mahic played,
598973485913735171,2019-07-11 20:26:47.431000+00:00,Yeah modern is cool in terms of deck diversity,
598942571187666945,2019-07-11 18:23:56.786000+00:00,^,
598941454081196042,2019-07-11 18:19:30.447000+00:00,Brennar its honestly sad how ignorant you are,
598913482846502938,2019-07-11 16:28:21.585000+00:00,Magic is love magic is life,
598913447681458196,2019-07-11 16:28:13.201000+00:00,Lame,
598909099014357003,2019-07-11 16:10:56.398000+00:00,And honestly legacy is more fun than modern,
598907468235669554,2019-07-11 16:04:27.590000+00:00,U might also have to get a few sb cards,
598907398631063587,2019-07-11 16:04:10.995000+00:00,U can play legacy next week with me and i assume holden,
598907294528438335,2019-07-11 16:03:46.175000+00:00,<@332566686488199188>  honestly just get fire blast and price and u basically have it,
598907144892317706,2019-07-11 16:03:10.499000+00:00,Legacy burn is fun,
598906124179341347,2019-07-11 15:59:07.142000+00:00,Cards nuts,
598906109838753822,2019-07-11 15:59:03.723000+00:00,Oh yeah i forgot about price,
598866119775879207,2019-07-11 13:20:09.349000+00:00,But combo isnt a big percent of tge meta game so burn can usually do ok,
598866000108322819,2019-07-11 13:19:40.818000+00:00,Eats,
598865985503756298,2019-07-11 13:19:37.336000+00:00,It eays dick against combo,
598865951764774913,2019-07-11 13:19:29.292000+00:00,Burn can do fine against fair decks,
598710796721192973,2019-07-11 03:02:57.447000+00:00,the real key diffrence is fireblast,
598710716412985345,2019-07-11 03:02:38.300000+00:00,its hard to go super wrong,
598710702160478209,2019-07-11 03:02:34.902000+00:00,although honestly its burn so its not like theres a stock list or anything,
598710633416097802,2019-07-11 03:02:18.512000+00:00,no its just like modern boros burn except it runs fireblast and no white spells,
598704910086701097,2019-07-11 02:39:33.964000+00:00,like basically just a few extra cards,
598704874435117056,2019-07-11 02:39:25.464000+00:00,its really not that much more expensive than modern burn,
598704839488307220,2019-07-11 02:39:17.132000+00:00,honestly brennar you should just build legacy burn,
598704555471142917,2019-07-11 02:38:09.417000+00:00,but meh ive spent enough money on magic recently,
598704528271081494,2019-07-11 02:38:02.932000+00:00,i could hoenstly see myself building modern and legacy burn at the same time at some point,
598703900077588494,2019-07-11 02:35:33.159000+00:00,but its a land that draws a card so its fine,
598703864367022110,2019-07-11 02:35:24.645000+00:00,no its mono red,
598703551321079848,2019-07-11 02:34:10.009000+00:00,it would be fine in burn but i dont really feel like making that,

597895889104797696,2019-07-08 21:04:48.331000+00:00,the original creator of the deck bounced back with this new version and went 4-1 in a leauge,
597895819261247500,2019-07-08 21:04:31.679000+00:00,https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/2072326#online,

597882569207447553,2019-07-08 20:11:52.620000+00:00,More tech for my esper colors deck,
597827120236068875,2019-07-08 16:31:32.555000+00:00,I guess the fact that the decks fine in leggcy os an indication that its too good in modern,
597824499227820053,2019-07-08 16:21:07.658000+00:00,Ill probably mess around with gaak vine too since i love those cards,
597824396782206978,2019-07-08 16:20:43.233000+00:00,At least i got my loams before they spiked,
597822048013778944,2019-07-08 16:11:23.243000+00:00,And also i guess a dredge player now,

597804703480414227,2019-07-08 15:02:27.984000+00:00,At least i can still play it in legacy,
597804645506613248,2019-07-08 15:02:14.162000+00:00,This is a bad hit,
597804414501257246,2019-07-08 15:01:19.086000+00:00,Nooooooooooo,

597779087431434253,2019-07-08 13:20:40.642000+00:00,Honestly maybe the gaak dosent need a ban,
597778414489042964,2019-07-08 13:18:00.200000+00:00,Just unban eye of ugin and the meta will balance,

597620370677432321,2019-07-08 02:49:59.619000+00:00,because thats a massively rude thing to say if wasn't like joking or something,

593948229717196803,2019-06-27 23:38:12.989000+00:00,its weird but when it comes to oathbreaker i find it harder to deck build,
593948148511014913,2019-06-27 23:37:53.628000+00:00,honestly bobby if you want to build me a daretti deck i might buy it if its cheap enough,
593948064822067202,2019-06-27 23:37:33.675000+00:00,oathbreaker i guess im looking at rakdos daretti,
593947997356818462,2019-06-27 23:37:17.590000+00:00,the two commanders im thinking about rn for edh are kykar and pheldegriff,
593947743081463810,2019-06-27 23:36:16.966000+00:00,when i built samut it was just elves but bigger and a bit slower,
593947669643132938,2019-06-27 23:35:59.457000+00:00,yeah my next edh deck is going to shy away from combo,
593947569298735105,2019-06-27 23:35:35.533000+00:00,or a 4th edh deck,
593947551351308319,2019-06-27 23:35:31.254000+00:00,wether i build an oathbreaker deck,
593947520665649153,2019-06-27 23:35:23.938000+00:00,the question is,

593947433050832915,2019-06-27 23:35:03.049000+00:00,but i think overall its fair,
593947412587085824,2019-06-27 23:34:58.170000+00:00,it can feel a little comboy due to the dredge,

592409310185652257,2019-06-23 17:43:05.981000+00:00,lol,
592409055931269124,2019-06-23 17:42:05.362000+00:00,193 is pretty good for a new commander,
592408934917079040,2019-06-23 17:41:36.510000+00:00,we can argue in person later,
592408844119048202,2019-06-23 17:41:14.862000+00:00,go be wrong somewhere else,

592408723037880340,2019-06-23 17:40:45.994000+00:00,hmmm,
592408718251917333,2019-06-23 17:40:44.853000+00:00,urza is also seeing major play as a cedh commander,
592408683581931544,2019-06-23 17:40:36.587000+00:00,thats a pretty decent amount,
592408645191467008,2019-06-23 17:40:27.434000+00:00,there are 193 urza decks on edhrec,
592408588820152330,2019-06-23 17:40:13.994000+00:00,commander,
592408580989124628,2019-06-23 17:40:12.127000+00:00,you forget about a major factor,
592408342249603073,2019-06-23 17:39:15.207000+00:00,but that is part of the reason,
592408324129947648,2019-06-23 17:39:10.887000+00:00,urza isnt more expsenive than hogaak because it is a mythic,
592408257725857805,2019-06-23 17:38:55.055000+00:00,its a factor though,
592408100645109768,2019-06-23 17:38:17.604000+00:00,whats your piont,
592408067396599809,2019-06-23 17:38:09.677000+00:00,yeah i know that,
592407856649863206,2019-06-23 17:37:19.431000+00:00,robby what are you even trying to argue?,
592407824525688853,2019-06-23 17:37:11.772000+00:00,that card sees no play anywhere,
592407726278049807,2019-06-23 17:36:48.348000+00:00,which grixis whirza consistantly shows up in,
592407650558410752,2019-06-23 17:36:30.295000+00:00,there have only been 5-0s and mtgo challenges,
592407603351650317,2019-06-23 17:36:19.040000+00:00,urza is also still a new deck so you cant really judge the meta on it,
592407553015676965,2019-06-23 17:36:07.039000+00:00,mythic vs rare,
592407426808938532,2019-06-23 17:35:36.949000+00:00,but he's still seeing play,
592407410941886474,2019-06-23 17:35:33.166000+00:00,he's no hogaak,
592407398308642825,2019-06-23 17:35:30.154000+00:00,yeah i mean he's not seeing a huge amount of play,
592406987615109128,2019-06-23 17:33:52.237000+00:00,also improvise,
592406885722750997,2019-06-23 17:33:27.944000+00:00,mox opal,
592406769263837256,2019-06-23 17:33:00.178000+00:00,and goblin engineer,
592406734941847571,2019-06-23 17:32:51.995000+00:00,and whir of inventian,
592406692499816478,2019-06-23 17:32:41.876000+00:00,also artifact decks get mox opal,
592406650673954826,2019-06-23 17:32:31.904000+00:00,also kiki jikki is more expensive,
592406605392248833,2019-06-23 17:32:21.108000+00:00,also artifacts are harder to remove than creatures,
592406552783224833,2019-06-23 17:32:08.565000+00:00,urza just makes it better,
592406533984223264,2019-06-23 17:32:04.083000+00:00,well thopter sword is a two card combo on its own,
592406152109883423,2019-06-23 17:30:33.037000+00:00,it combos with thopter sword in modern which is why its seeing play there,
592406062515355658,2019-06-23 17:30:11.676000+00:00,win con in the command zone with infinite mana,
592406034820104202,2019-06-23 17:30:05.073000+00:00,same reason thrasios is good,
592405985180647444,2019-06-23 17:29:53.238000+00:00,with infinite mana,
592405976343379972,2019-06-23 17:29:51.131000+00:00,yes,
592405946672873472,2019-06-23 17:29:44.057000+00:00,oh and a karnstruct,
592405847166943291,2019-06-23 17:29:20.333000+00:00,yeah its like bad tolarian acedmy+win con on a stick,
592405782964863005,2019-06-23 17:29:05.026000+00:00,ah,
592405680623976449,2019-06-23 17:28:40.626000+00:00,?,
592405461681176658,2019-06-23 17:27:48.426000+00:00,its just got commander demand,
592405438142611456,2019-06-23 17:27:42.814000+00:00,doubeling season sees no play in compettive formats...,
592405204108967947,2019-06-23 17:26:47.016000+00:00,but its not seeing play,
592405150245716093,2019-06-23 17:26:34.174000+00:00,and a lot of commander demand,
592405123473342496,2019-06-23 17:26:27.791000+00:00,urza sees a good amount of modern play,
592405063222165505,2019-06-23 17:26:13.426000+00:00,its still being tested in modern i believe,
592405018292781066,2019-06-23 17:26:02.714000+00:00,wrenn and six is starting to see legacy play,
592404816827908098,2019-06-23 17:25:14.681000+00:00,mythic,
592404591014838312,2019-06-23 17:24:20.843000+00:00,urza probably wont get banned,
592403912628240415,2019-06-23 17:21:39.103000+00:00,but 180 seems low,
592403846362431491,2019-06-23 17:21:23.304000+00:00,idk,
592402839280549891,2019-06-23 17:17:23.197000+00:00,i mean dan did say he saw some people do good with ti,
592402794519068695,2019-06-23 17:17:12.525000+00:00,yeah,
592402275042066462,2019-06-23 17:15:08.672000+00:00,ye,
592395732594458626,2019-06-23 16:49:08.831000+00:00,i dont see the deck oftern and havent played it in a while,
592395675669495979,2019-06-23 16:48:55.259000+00:00,but i really just dont know enough,
592395643910094848,2019-06-23 16:48:47.687000+00:00,yeah i'd like to try to asnwer,
592395514860011563,2019-06-23 16:48:16.919000+00:00,probably a better question for <@!242014433365196810>,
592394901917007874,2019-06-23 16:45:50.782000+00:00,and i dont think this is what it needs to get there,
592394872112152741,2019-06-23 16:45:43.676000+00:00,yeah but pyromancer isnt even that great in the current meta,
592394827476369413,2019-06-23 16:45:33.034000+00:00,hmm,
592394246884163604,2019-06-23 16:43:14.610000+00:00,heres a skred list,
592394225711054849,2019-06-23 16:43:09.562000+00:00,https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/2016367#paper,
592394073860472872,2019-06-23 16:42:33.358000+00:00,yeah idk about that,
592394046501158949,2019-06-23 16:42:26.835000+00:00,hmm,
592393381204983826,2019-06-23 16:39:48.216000+00:00,but ya never know,
592393366340239479,2019-06-23 16:39:44.672000+00:00,probably not,
592393355263082535,2019-06-23 16:39:42.031000+00:00,could this be what it takes to bring out out from obscurity?,
592393257963749386,2019-06-23 16:39:18.833000+00:00,but thats a pretty niche deck,
592393232365649920,2019-06-23 16:39:12.730000+00:00,"i think if anything it could go in skred, which runs a decent amount of red walkers",
592393148471443457,2019-06-23 16:38:52.728000+00:00,i think the biggest thing is that im not really sure if the card has a home in modern,
592391927081467925,2019-06-23 16:34:01.526000+00:00,it seems deece,
592391914116874252,2019-06-23 16:33:58.435000+00:00,but idk,
592391907305455636,2019-06-23 16:33:56.811000+00:00,i mean theres also a chance it sees no play anywhere,
592391827781320716,2019-06-23 16:33:37.851000+00:00,this card wont drop any lower probably,
592391796043153418,2019-06-23 16:33:30.284000+00:00,i recommend doing it now,
592391784030797847,2019-06-23 16:33:27.420000+00:00,if you plan on picking them up,
592391620687691780,2019-06-23 16:32:48.476000+00:00,yup,
592391536038117389,2019-06-23 16:32:28.294000+00:00,channel fireball is selling em,
592391331389767680,2019-06-23 16:31:39.502000+00:00,yeah its a bit early,
592391187172687882,2019-06-23 16:31:05.118000+00:00,not if you use a reputable source,
592391054980808707,2019-06-23 16:30:33.601000+00:00,any planeswalker cmc 3 or less deserves consideration when it comes to playability in modern,
592390920385855498,2019-06-23 16:30:01.511000+00:00,i might pick it up with my next order lol,
592390873795526657,2019-06-23 16:29:50.403000+00:00,dang for only 2 bucks...,
592390828173951006,2019-06-23 16:29:39.526000+00:00,yeah i think she seems super playable,
592390803394002968,2019-06-23 16:29:33.618000+00:00,seriously?,
592389460793229357,2019-06-23 16:24:13.517000+00:00,snappy is da king,
592389439678971917,2019-06-23 16:24:08.483000+00:00,but if we're talking modern,
592389423627239444,2019-06-23 16:24:04.656000+00:00,i suppose it depends on the format,
592389378760769546,2019-06-23 16:23:53.959000+00:00,he's definatly not better than snappy,
592389321554919434,2019-06-23 16:23:40.320000+00:00,ok,
592388897011662858,2019-06-23 16:21:59.101000+00:00,just that its probably not right to compare her to snaper,
592388856427446327,2019-06-23 16:21:49.425000+00:00,yeah i mean im not saying she's not good,
592387254882664449,2019-06-23 16:15:27.587000+00:00,snapy boi has flash,
592387233454096404,2019-06-23 16:15:22.478000+00:00,not really,
592360919191781376,2019-06-23 14:30:48.669000+00:00,honestly if a reanimator strat becomes prevalent in standard i might be tempted to play lol,
592028141526974477,2019-06-22 16:28:28.291000+00:00,but nothing that can happen quickly,
592028114834554912,2019-06-22 16:28:21.927000+00:00,there are combos,
592028017207803909,2019-06-22 16:27:58.651000+00:00,so it doesnt drift too close to storm,
592027990074982468,2019-06-22 16:27:52.182000+00:00,im trying to focus a bit on fun cards for this deck,
592027831689674836,2019-06-22 16:27:14.420000+00:00,there are more fun things mystical tutor can grab,
592027796860174338,2019-06-22 16:27:06.116000+00:00,lol probs not,
592027752136441868,2019-06-22 16:26:55.453000+00:00,good cuz im doin it,
592023254361833473,2019-06-22 16:09:03.100000+00:00,would it be bad if i put Armageddon in kykar because i believe kykar would be able to bounce back faster than most decks?,
591971977477226499,2019-06-22 12:45:17.738000+00:00,who woulda thunk,
591970352800727071,2019-06-22 12:38:50.385000+00:00,i'll have to find it,
591970342386401302,2019-06-22 12:38:47.902000+00:00,i have one around somewhere,
591969409602682897,2019-06-22 12:35:05.509000+00:00,in both phoenix decks,

591660453495832578,2019-06-21 16:07:24.633000+00:00,Holy shit brennar,
591659228167667712,2019-06-21 16:02:32.492000+00:00,U guys are gay,
591478264703352834,2019-06-21 04:03:27.440000+00:00,ive cast him multiple times,
591478242314289172,2019-06-21 04:03:22.102000+00:00,thats a lie,
591478123032477696,2019-06-21 04:02:53.663000+00:00,its just a lot of the times i have something better too,
591478079403065344,2019-06-21 04:02:43.261000+00:00,i still use ghave,
591477751668670475,2019-06-21 04:01:25.123000+00:00,so its like a puzzel of figureing out how exactly im going to hit a combo,
591477662149509128,2019-06-21 04:01:03.780000+00:00,and i have lots of tutors,
591477607644790784,2019-06-21 04:00:50.785000+00:00,the reason its fun for me is because there are like literally a hundred diffrent combos,
591477404137160705,2019-06-21 04:00:02.265000+00:00,i mean yeah most of the combos involve a sac outlet,
591477085185245184,2019-06-21 03:58:46.221000+00:00,there are lots of diffrent combos tho,
591476997230690334,2019-06-21 03:58:25.251000+00:00,you guys really arent paying that much attention to how i combo,
591476962376155136,2019-06-21 03:58:16.941000+00:00,but lets be honest,
591476945435230208,2019-06-21 03:58:12.902000+00:00,you guys say i always win the same way,
591476902452264980,2019-06-21 03:58:02.654000+00:00,ghave plays out fairly diffrently between games,
591476717323943956,2019-06-21 03:57:18.516000+00:00,but sidisi is fun too and more fair so ive been sticking with her more often,
591476661577580554,2019-06-21 03:57:05.225000+00:00,i still love playing ghave lol,
591476623996616705,2019-06-21 03:56:56.265000+00:00,😉,
591476440403411001,2019-06-21 03:56:12.493000+00:00,but thats why my next deck or two will try to be bascially no combos,
591476363496783872,2019-06-21 03:55:54.157000+00:00,no game with ghave is a nice game,
591476208487759872,2019-06-21 03:55:17.200000+00:00,and i mean thats why you just need to run some removal,
591475906787409921,2019-06-21 03:54:05.269000+00:00,"yeah i think  sidisi can get out of hand, but can also play a fair game",
591475821391249415,2019-06-21 03:53:44.909000+00:00,no,
591475598518648842,2019-06-21 03:52:51.772000+00:00,my plays would probably be pretty obvious,
591475565870055455,2019-06-21 03:52:43.988000+00:00,if people actually botherd to pay more attention to my graveyard,
591475521603502080,2019-06-21 03:52:33.434000+00:00,and i mean with sidisi,
591475485423435776,2019-06-21 03:52:24.808000+00:00,at least with ghave u know what comin lol,
591475458911109128,2019-06-21 03:52:18.487000+00:00,yeah two card combos can be annoying,
591475394444656672,2019-06-21 03:52:03.117000+00:00,lol,
591475130539180053,2019-06-21 03:51:00.197000+00:00,but not nothing,
591475115351605299,2019-06-21 03:50:56.576000+00:00,so i guess not that much,
591475086968619008,2019-06-21 03:50:49.809000+00:00,and one bored wipe,
591475069348478986,2019-06-21 03:50:45.608000+00:00,so i have 6 single target,
591474852393648159,2019-06-21 03:49:53.882000+00:00,yeah i mean if i can just win i do that instead,
591474822123487242,2019-06-21 03:49:46.665000+00:00,fair,
591474620880912394,2019-06-21 03:48:58.685000+00:00,its mostly just for clearing space for combos,
591474563158769665,2019-06-21 03:48:44.923000+00:00,but ghave has a decent amount,
591474542057226250,2019-06-21 03:48:39.892000+00:00,like mb one or two cards,
591474525108043801,2019-06-21 03:48:35.851000+00:00,sidisi uses very little,
591474128574480386,2019-06-21 03:47:01.310000+00:00,it wouldnt be as much of a problem,
591474103857184819,2019-06-21 03:46:55.417000+00:00,i mean honestly if you ran more removal like me and brennar,
591473747999981576,2019-06-21 03:45:30.574000+00:00,it could easily be built as a combo storm deck,
591473699908222976,2019-06-21 03:45:19.108000+00:00,hopefully with minmal to no combo,
591473674482089994,2019-06-21 03:45:13.046000+00:00,yeah im building kykar as a fair deck,
591473616106029085,2019-06-21 03:44:59.128000+00:00,often times there are other combos that i could go for but protean hulk is easiest,
591473524221149185,2019-06-21 03:44:37.221000+00:00,ill be honest the only reason protean hulk is the combo i use so often is because it takes the least brain power to do,
591473362862342145,2019-06-21 03:43:58.750000+00:00,y,

591472630905700362,2019-06-21 03:41:04.238000+00:00,thats why its shitty to target someone based on commander,

591465779099074572,2019-06-21 03:13:50.640000+00:00,he tried to pull this bs where he had a flipped magic card in a sleeve and called it the new liliana,
591465580393922581,2019-06-21 03:13:03.265000+00:00,he seems like a trashy person,

590657615382708224,2019-06-18 21:42:29.395000+00:00,A large number of cantrips and what not,
590657507345563735,2019-06-18 21:42:03.637000+00:00,I mean no matter what there will be a decent amount of instants/sorceries due to the nature of the commander,
590657326990622765,2019-06-18 21:41:20.637000+00:00,And i can use powerful walkers that support tokens,
590657231133999135,2019-06-18 21:40:57.783000+00:00,I think walkers would be neat since the tokens protect the walkers,
590657082752237600,2019-06-18 21:40:22.406000+00:00,Although i could always go with storm/cheerios combo,
590656970101489665,2019-06-18 21:39:55.548000+00:00,Rn im between superfriends or just a token build,
590656841176973330,2019-06-18 21:39:24.810000+00:00,Deciding what direction to go with kykar is tough,
590575847740538900,2019-06-18 16:17:34.470000+00:00,Instead of pronting fair kaalia they just printed bad kaalia,
590575769386745856,2019-06-18 16:17:15.789000+00:00,Dang i misread kaalia and thought it was attacks,

590362237072572425,2019-06-18 02:08:45.718000+00:00,yeet they don it,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/590362236556410882/leylineofthevoid.png
590362151646920705,2019-06-18 02:08:25.351000+00:00,and ghave is bad smh,
590354518013902848,2019-06-18 01:38:05.351000+00:00,but also yeah i hope they do something like that again,
590354490369114161,2019-06-18 01:37:58.760000+00:00,weeb,
590290809518161922,2019-06-17 21:24:56.062000+00:00,Oathbreaker is still nothing compared to edh,
590290761829056512,2019-06-17 21:24:44.692000+00:00,Eh i kinda doubt it atm,
590290328544608269,2019-06-17 21:23:01.389000+00:00,Are there any abzan walkers?,
590281681446109184,2019-06-17 20:48:39.760000+00:00,<@!332566686488199188> do you think this will cause void to go up or down?,
590281623254073488,2019-06-17 20:48:25.886000+00:00,so i think void is basically confirmed at this point,
590281594057785344,2019-06-17 20:48:18.925000+00:00,i saw a rumor a while ago that said sanctity and void were going to be printed in m20,
590281509643091968,2019-06-17 20:47:58.799000+00:00,the mad men actually did it,
590281486372962305,2019-06-17 20:47:53.251000+00:00,https://twitter.com/JRolfMTG/status/1140691393813405697,
590280681968500765,2019-06-17 20:44:41.466000+00:00,its basically a significantly better talrand,
590280638939004938,2019-06-17 20:44:31.207000+00:00,honestly this card seems great,
590280443430174730,2019-06-17 20:43:44.594000+00:00,especially if i have something like annointed procession out,
590280406071509012,2019-06-17 20:43:35.687000+00:00,for a giant fireball,
590280365298417664,2019-06-17 20:43:25.966000+00:00,or i could go off and then sac a bunch of spirits that remain,
590280242426413083,2019-06-17 20:42:56.671000+00:00,can easily cast a lot of spells for free or close to it,
590280182661775361,2019-06-17 20:42:42.422000+00:00,especially with like a baral or a gobo electromancer out,
590280102487654426,2019-06-17 20:42:23.307000+00:00,dude this card is ripe for storm potential,
590279745342799873,2019-06-17 20:40:58.157000+00:00,since thats just what happens when i build decks i guess,
590279687842955265,2019-06-17 20:40:44.448000+00:00,and its going to end up being a fast storm combo deck that ends games on turn 4,
590279616359301134,2019-06-17 20:40:27.405000+00:00,im going to make kykar with the intintion of making a token swarm spellslinger deck,
590276748197756939,2019-06-17 20:29:03.582000+00:00,Very,

590180495070068752,2019-06-17 14:06:35.048000+00:00,Part of me wants to sell bridgevine while its hot,
590180405504901141,2019-06-17 14:06:13.694000+00:00,I could see this seeing play in a lot of formats,
590180294519160832,2019-06-17 14:05:47.233000+00:00,Mill for example,
590180256422428694,2019-06-17 14:05:38.150000+00:00,I mean this can be used in a one sided way in tge right deck,
590168127082332191,2019-06-17 13:17:26.290000+00:00,Lol that card seems fun in commander,

587754432410681396,2019-06-10 21:26:16.636000+00:00,it can win through tormod cryps and relics,

587753887914786837,2019-06-10 21:24:06.818000+00:00,no combo,
587753726698061833,2019-06-10 21:23:28.381000+00:00,even if it makes the deck worse,

587739937672265768,2019-06-10 20:28:40.821000+00:00,But hopefully as people learn how to play against the deck that percent will go down,
587739817350004856,2019-06-10 20:28:12.134000+00:00,An 80% win percentage is crazy,
587739741114335273,2019-06-10 20:27:53.958000+00:00,I think we should wait and see how the meta adjusts,

586902858188718080,2019-06-08 13:02:25.520000+00:00,but it does stand pretty much 0 chance against combo decks,

584957520913891328,2019-06-03 04:12:20.971000+00:00,lol ye,
584957375660949515,2019-06-03 04:11:46.340000+00:00,like if a new deck archetype becomes popular you're going to have an easier time offloading cards for that type,
584957245901766656,2019-06-03 04:11:15.403000+00:00,i mean some cards are more in demand then others,
584956610435219479,2019-06-03 04:08:43.896000+00:00,and usually if you sell you lose value,
584956540516040741,2019-06-03 04:08:27.226000+00:00,i mean it depends on the card,
584956120636981274,2019-06-03 04:06:47.119000+00:00,dont be like robby and buy multiple rifts,

584951210994565140,2019-06-03 03:47:16.569000+00:00,and the win con is combat damage,
584951182708047877,2019-06-03 03:47:09.825000+00:00,but he's demon tribal,

584943877807407117,2019-06-03 03:18:08.201000+00:00,from what ive heard rith is what edh used to be like,
584943322217316352,2019-06-03 03:15:55.738000+00:00,ye,
584943059209551932,2019-06-03 03:14:53.032000+00:00,act,
584942445633077258,2019-06-03 03:12:26.744000+00:00,i mean yeah def proxy cyclonic rift,
584941860884185088,2019-06-03 03:10:07.329000+00:00,I mean proxying a 10 dollar card is a little weird but as long as you own it its not really a big deal,
584941344561037342,2019-06-03 03:08:04.228000+00:00,mutavaults good,
584941129326395402,2019-06-03 03:07:12.912000+00:00,although i guess the battlebond lands are best,
584941083168079878,2019-06-03 03:07:01.907000+00:00,i like putting shocks in my decks,
584941058673344523,2019-06-03 03:06:56.067000+00:00,hmm,
584940876392824834,2019-06-03 03:06:12.608000+00:00,wut since when,
584940833053212685,2019-06-03 03:06:02.275000+00:00,well dont u have like steam vents and stuff,
584940705890304000,2019-06-03 03:05:31.957000+00:00,i assume some of the cards you have means a lot of the land base,
584940650634674177,2019-06-03 03:05:18.783000+00:00,noice,
584940180520173588,2019-06-03 03:03:26.699000+00:00,i think ur lewd,
584939770111721472,2019-06-03 03:01:48.850000+00:00,y not bang ooddecks?,
584939593153904650,2019-06-03 03:01:06.660000+00:00,yes lets bang ooddecks,
584936890508116008,2019-06-03 02:50:22.299000+00:00,id say as far as combo decks go mine has a wide variety of options,
584936805241978880,2019-06-03 02:50:01.970000+00:00,illusionest bracers and an altar,
584936745691512833,2019-06-03 02:49:47.772000+00:00,rite and strangleroot gyste is fun,
584936704323092482,2019-06-03 02:49:37.909000+00:00,theres also the revillark combo package,
584936484537368577,2019-06-03 02:48:45.508000+00:00,maybe i should check to see if i accedentally didnt put it in,
584936417096892423,2019-06-03 02:48:29.429000+00:00,although i never draw that card,
584936378903560212,2019-06-03 02:48:20.323000+00:00,also blasting station can replace altar,
584936341167669259,2019-06-03 02:48:11.326000+00:00,usually blood artist along with those will do it,
584936273215488040,2019-06-03 02:47:55.125000+00:00,i mean all of the undying/persist combos with phyrexian ashnods altar,
584936167170900007,2019-06-03 02:47:29.842000+00:00,although it can be bad in longer games where i draw combo pieces,
584936108429934592,2019-06-03 02:47:15.837000+00:00,since most of my combos need 2 pieces to work while protean hulk just needs to die once,
584936037890129930,2019-06-03 02:46:59.019000+00:00,yeah i guess,
584936000179142656,2019-06-03 02:46:50.028000+00:00,i mean maybe,
584935948500860938,2019-06-03 02:46:37.707000+00:00,protean hulk is just the simpilist option most of the time,
584935892297187328,2019-06-03 02:46:24.307000+00:00,hey ghave doesent rely on protean hulk every time,
584935841835778070,2019-06-03 02:46:12.276000+00:00,and honestly decks that make everyone draw all the time are fun,
584935549450846219,2019-06-03 02:45:02.566000+00:00,i really like the idea of loading someone up with hippo tokens until they die,
584935358249304084,2019-06-03 02:44:16.980000+00:00,pretty much like a hug u to death kinda deck,
584935269724192821,2019-06-03 02:43:55.874000+00:00,i think doing a control/group hug deck with him would be fun,
584935220093124618,2019-06-03 02:43:44.041000+00:00,I like Phelddagrif since he's in bant colors which is a color pairing ive never really played,
584935134999085058,2019-06-03 02:43:23.753000+00:00,but im not rn since its black lel,
584935093341126656,2019-06-03 02:43:13.821000+00:00,ive been thinking about making a nicol bolas discard deck,
584935054229241878,2019-06-03 02:43:04.496000+00:00,lol ye,
584934984884813824,2019-06-03 02:42:47.963000+00:00,he would be good,
584934973233037318,2019-06-03 02:42:45.185000+00:00,noice,
584934857415720970,2019-06-03 02:42:17.572000+00:00,Nath?,
584934463767707648,2019-06-03 02:40:43.719000+00:00,right now im building pheldagrif tho,
584934400794427393,2019-06-03 02:40:28.705000+00:00,overall i do think i like playing toshi and would like to build him at some point in the future,
584934165317681152,2019-06-03 02:39:32.563000+00:00,you're kind of right but a lot of mono black decks tend to devolve into the same goodstuff unless they have a more focused theme,
584934084602626061,2019-06-03 02:39:13.319000+00:00,ye,
584934006391439371,2019-06-03 02:38:54.672000+00:00,well i mean mono black decks tend to be big mana exsanguinate,
584933810119114760,2019-06-03 02:38:07.877000+00:00,but the deck def needs to be optimized,
584933780918370304,2019-06-03 02:38:00.915000+00:00,toshi is actually kind of hard to play,
584933756293611539,2019-06-03 02:37:55.044000+00:00,yeah probably,
584933650630574082,2019-06-03 02:37:29.852000+00:00,although i dont remember ur sitation i do know u were tapped out a lot that game,
584933541830459392,2019-06-03 02:37:03.912000+00:00,if i did it the other way around i probably would have won,
584933472590757911,2019-06-03 02:36:47.404000+00:00,and i drew none of them lol,
584933433156042752,2019-06-03 02:36:38.002000+00:00,i actually probably could have won but i sequenced a magus of the will sacrifice wrong,
584933317359435786,2019-06-03 02:36:10.394000+00:00,torment of hailfire,

584932856401494026,2019-06-03 02:34:20.493000+00:00,yeah people who dont decide games that way just suck,

582672776205172828,2019-05-27 20:53:35.384000+00:00,im kinda hyped for it,
582672723369525279,2019-05-27 20:53:22.787000+00:00,good good,
582672634911916041,2019-05-27 20:53:01.697000+00:00,are you going to do the modern horizons draft brennar?,
582672328949891084,2019-05-27 20:51:48.750000+00:00,yeah im thinking not ugin related,
582672280270929950,2019-05-27 20:51:37.144000+00:00,idk,
582672271425142809,2019-05-27 20:51:35.035000+00:00,i mean maybe ugin congured it?,
582672188184985610,2019-05-27 20:51:15.189000+00:00,i think its just a normal spirit boi,
582672137807069219,2019-05-27 20:51:03.178000+00:00,def not ugin,
582655043958865969,2019-05-27 19:43:07.687000+00:00,oh maybe im just thinking of the fact that yuriko is a strong commander,
582654863993864214,2019-05-27 19:42:24.780000+00:00,well since the ninja commmander came out,
582654742908370976,2019-05-27 19:41:55.911000+00:00,ninja tribal has always been very playable,
582654406500155422,2019-05-27 19:40:35.705000+00:00,dang,
582628236278759434,2019-05-27 17:56:36.238000+00:00,and won a good amount of games with that card,
582628195749199872,2019-05-27 17:56:26.575000+00:00,i mean ive played the deck with devisation,
582628116015349771,2019-05-27 17:56:07.565000+00:00,where i would say devistation works better,
582628055584079937,2019-05-27 17:55:53.157000+00:00,im thinking about it in the devoted druid combo deck,
582627791632072715,2019-05-27 17:54:50.226000+00:00,but like we already have finale of devistation which serves a very similar role,
582627733855797271,2019-05-27 17:54:36.451000+00:00,i can see it as a two of in some decks,
582627672945852426,2019-05-27 17:54:21.929000+00:00,idk how good eladmris call will be in modern,
582627374307344393,2019-05-27 17:53:10.728000+00:00,although yeah i honestly dont think she would get played enough for the card to go up too much,
582627291947859978,2019-05-27 17:52:51.092000+00:00,and if she's printed at mythic and playable its possible,
582627252882374666,2019-05-27 17:52:41.778000+00:00,i said if she's playable she will,
582627232292405308,2019-05-27 17:52:36.869000+00:00,no,
582627138876866582,2019-05-27 17:52:14.597000+00:00,but it might be slow for commander,
582627111508901898,2019-05-27 17:52:08.072000+00:00,super powerful card,
582627084002787351,2019-05-27 17:52:01.514000+00:00,honestily idk if she is,
582627033331531819,2019-05-27 17:51:49.433000+00:00,she would only go up,
582627019372626000,2019-05-27 17:51:46.105000+00:00,like if atraxa is modern playable,
582626993581850646,2019-05-27 17:51:39.956000+00:00,dude idk this set is sketchy for reprints,

582626887432667196,2019-05-27 17:51:14.648000+00:00,yeah but y do u want atraxa so bad?,

582626717835984920,2019-05-27 17:50:34.213000+00:00,that would be cray cray,
582617858656305182,2019-05-27 17:15:22.020000+00:00,but i mean it probably deserves that rarity,
582617816163680263,2019-05-27 17:15:11.889000+00:00,yeah thats fair,

582361740080185354,2019-05-27 00:17:38.593000+00:00,probably because i dont think we're going to play magic,

582005658912686081,2019-05-26 00:42:42.227000+00:00,http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/hippo-hulk/,
582000588678627329,2019-05-26 00:22:33.389000+00:00,probably doesnt beet batterskull and jitte tho so idk,
582000526376435712,2019-05-26 00:22:18.535000+00:00,im not certain but it doesnt seem out of the question,
582000474165739520,2019-05-26 00:22:06.087000+00:00,i could see the blue white one seeing play in legacy,
582000421430755348,2019-05-26 00:21:53.514000+00:00,fair,
582000225351237633,2019-05-26 00:21:06.765000+00:00,like the counter and proliferate is some value,
582000181621293066,2019-05-26 00:20:56.339000+00:00,people are hating on the other new sword but that one seems pretty good tbh,
582000131252027393,2019-05-26 00:20:44.330000+00:00,probably yeah,
581999966545903637,2019-05-26 00:20:05.061000+00:00,but this probably wont see play in any other formats,
581999907829710850,2019-05-26 00:19:51.062000+00:00,i think in edh its probably good,
581991161397248010,2019-05-25 23:45:05.750000+00:00,honestly doesnt seem that great,
581991092954595342,2019-05-25 23:44:49.432000+00:00,heres another one,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/581991092954595341/r0b7l4bqzf031.png
581932487287111720,2019-05-25 19:51:56.752000+00:00,being in the precons would be weird,
581932463035514900,2019-05-25 19:51:50.970000+00:00,yeah idk where they'll put it,
581930542329626624,2019-05-25 19:44:13.038000+00:00,i think this is a pretty good sign that they will,
581930497580597248,2019-05-25 19:44:02.369000+00:00,hopefully they finish them up eventually,
581930468103028739,2019-05-25 19:43:55.341000+00:00,ye,
581908349608525824,2019-05-25 18:16:01.881000+00:00,its just enchantment effects that you would need to be concerned about,
581908298660577311,2019-05-25 18:15:49.734000+00:00,you're not worried about derivi dying or getting exiled,
581908248228003861,2019-05-25 18:15:37.710000+00:00,since i mean,
581903962542833670,2019-05-25 17:58:35.923000+00:00,but those types of cards arent super common so eh,
581903847207731242,2019-05-25 17:58:08.425000+00:00,i think the only reason you would need swiftfoot boots is for something like lignify,
581903692412878848,2019-05-25 17:57:31.519000+00:00,derevi doesnt need protection,
581903666618040340,2019-05-25 17:57:25.369000+00:00,i dont think you need it,
581897951111020562,2019-05-25 17:34:42.686000+00:00,you could probably just throw a sword into derevi and it would be fine tho lol,
581897836053004288,2019-05-25 17:34:15.254000+00:00,and honestly i might be interested lol,
581897813991096322,2019-05-25 17:34:09.994000+00:00,we'll see if we get any more swords,
581897246023614475,2019-05-25 17:31:54.580000+00:00,yeah i mean this is probably more of a commander card than anything,
581655781561335818,2019-05-25 01:32:24.966000+00:00,Dang son,

581594132577910794,2019-05-24 21:27:26.703000+00:00,Grab 3 creatures,
581594109647519802,2019-05-24 21:27:21.236000+00:00,Stitch together for two mana,
581594037518336018,2019-05-24 21:27:04.039000+00:00,Altgough actually as a reanimation target he could be decent,
581593966781399041,2019-05-24 21:26:47.174000+00:00,Hmm,

581593832278458379,2019-05-24 21:26:15.106000+00:00,The body isnt super relevant,
581593725860446221,2019-05-24 21:25:49.734000+00:00,Rot hulk isnt great,
581593415297400858,2019-05-24 21:24:35.690000+00:00,It needs to exist to kill strong lands,
581593324910280704,2019-05-24 21:24:14.140000+00:00,Wastelands not nearly as bad,
581592975142944798,2019-05-24 21:22:50.749000+00:00,Strip mine is stupid and bad,

579350110270652429,2019-05-18 16:50:30.093000+00:00,the reason its so good in modern is because of how flexible the deck is,
579349961380986900,2019-05-18 16:49:54.595000+00:00,and they can just hard cast the pheonix,

573633480441724937,2019-05-02 22:14:39.332000+00:00,it made mulling with dredge really nice since i could stick all the cards i want to put into my graveyard from my library back away,

573626768523657238,2019-05-02 21:47:59.086000+00:00,like my opponents just frequently concede randomly,
573626726962429952,2019-05-02 21:47:49.177000+00:00,legacy confuses me so much,

573322371700621322,2019-05-02 01:38:25.228000+00:00,and i figured we'd at least break even,
573322340738269184,2019-05-02 01:38:17.846000+00:00,i thought it would be fun,
573322306668068866,2019-05-02 01:38:09.723000+00:00,but i would be a little miffed if both mine and jacks get refunded,
573322267522629642,2019-05-02 01:38:00.390000+00:00,honestly i dont care too too much if i get the box,

573321705850929165,2019-05-02 01:35:46.477000+00:00,like it initally said it was sold out around 3:04,

573321273611124746,2019-05-02 01:34:03.423000+00:00,and then it did,
573321259266473985,2019-05-02 01:34:00.003000+00:00,and then i bought an extra just cuz i didnt think it would go through,

573320980945174539,2019-05-02 01:32:53.646000+00:00,that would be kind of messed up since i got mine so late,
573320924166881290,2019-05-02 01:32:40.109000+00:00,but i get mine,

573320790091759626,2019-05-02 01:32:08.143000+00:00,and the fact that both of us got a box helps my odds,
573320749922779137,2019-05-02 01:31:58.566000+00:00,im not too concernd about my box as long as me and jack get ours,
573320420540022790,2019-05-02 01:30:40.035000+00:00,until i see the shipping email,
573320402370166784,2019-05-02 01:30:35.703000+00:00,thats why i said i wouldnt be sure if i acutally got it,

573320228042440709,2019-05-02 01:29:54.140000+00:00,since i orderd mine around 3:40,

573320184295849986,2019-05-02 01:29:43.710000+00:00,hopefully we'll find out soon,
573319875163062272,2019-05-02 01:28:30.007000+00:00,in fact around 3:10 people were asking if anyone had a succesful order,
573319752848769085,2019-05-02 01:28:00.845000+00:00,there where a lot of people saying that theres got canceld in the beggining,
573319650704621618,2019-05-02 01:27:36.492000+00:00,lol did u read those reddit comments?,
573319515031732224,2019-05-02 01:27:04.145000+00:00,its already hapend,
573319500422971392,2019-05-02 01:27:00.662000+00:00,...,
573319496551497756,2019-05-02 01:26:59.739000+00:00,becuase,
573319487055593473,2019-05-02 01:26:57.475000+00:00,thats why i wasnt sure if there would be a wave,
573319456756072459,2019-05-02 01:26:50.251000+00:00,the number is so big because a bunch of orders have already been canceld,
573319389898604545,2019-05-02 01:26:34.311000+00:00,thats what i was saying earlier,
573319303932280832,2019-05-02 01:26:13.815000+00:00,y,
573319259124531212,2019-05-02 01:26:03.132000+00:00,jack got in pretty early so he should be good,
573319175641235498,2019-05-02 01:25:43.228000+00:00,i guess we'll see,
573318507710906390,2019-05-02 01:23:03.981000+00:00,so people dont have to actually buy the thing for the counter to go up,
573318452496957443,2019-05-02 01:22:50.817000+00:00,but the way ebay works is every time an order is placed it counts as a sale on the counter,
573318339032645645,2019-05-02 01:22:23.765000+00:00,that would suck,
573318306186919936,2019-05-02 01:22:15.934000+00:00,hopefully there wont be a wave of cancelations,
573318276776460315,2019-05-02 01:22:08.922000+00:00,or have already been canceld,
573318136728780800,2019-05-02 01:21:35.532000+00:00,a lot of people had to go back and redo it,
573318084656365569,2019-05-02 01:21:23.117000+00:00,a huge amount of the first orders got canceld,
573318054633537546,2019-05-02 01:21:15.959000+00:00,lol honestly if anything a lot of the bot orders got canceld,
573317774441447444,2019-05-02 01:20:09.156000+00:00,people are super pissed lol,
573317648625041408,2019-05-02 01:19:39.159000+00:00,so i guess i cant be too sure,
573317627179565074,2019-05-02 01:19:34.046000+00:00,wizards still hasnt explained themselves,

573238607188459531,2019-05-01 20:05:34.212000+00:00,for the cheap ones i might just do a tcg player buy list to dump em,
573238347099668490,2019-05-01 20:04:32.202000+00:00,so i imagine jace and ugin will have a higher market price next year than next week,
573238223233613832,2019-05-01 20:04:02.670000+00:00,the cheaper ones start high and drop quickly,
573238128488480778,2019-05-01 20:03:40.081000+00:00,and then start climbing again,
573238103330914314,2019-05-01 20:03:34.083000+00:00,and big ticket items tend to dip,
573238077917626368,2019-05-01 20:03:28.024000+00:00,i was looking at past boxes,
573238025203744798,2019-05-01 20:03:15.456000+00:00,i mean just the ugin and jace are what you want right,
573237991343128606,2019-05-01 20:03:07.383000+00:00,if i get my box i think i might just hold for a bit on the big bois,
573237803127930890,2019-05-01 20:02:22.509000+00:00,if me and jack get the box we'll probably just sell to you,
573237482670260237,2019-05-01 20:01:06.106000+00:00,everything else looks to be below 100,
573237451217305630,2019-05-01 20:00:58.607000+00:00,those are the three standouts i think,

573235657884041226,2019-05-01 19:53:51.043000+00:00,honestly im not going to be confident we even got it until i see a shipping confirmation,
573235243608309770,2019-05-01 19:52:12.272000+00:00,probably going to go down when people relize the print run was 3.5x bigger than they said,
573235170866626560,2019-05-01 19:51:54.929000+00:00,the prices we're looking pretty high,

573234595634479104,2019-05-01 19:49:37.783000+00:00,honestly a little annoyed they lied,
573234482837061740,2019-05-01 19:49:10.890000+00:00,looks like it might be done at 42,
573234190972223505,2019-05-01 19:48:01.304000+00:00,but it was getting restocked in waves,

572951644380200980,2019-05-01 01:05:16.947000+00:00,what did brian do,
572951547013496842,2019-05-01 01:04:53.733000+00:00,Breakthrough is a real mvp,
572951025305255976,2019-05-01 01:02:49.348000+00:00,and honestly the lions eye diamonds didnt really do much most of the time,
572950647805313028,2019-05-01 01:01:19.345000+00:00,being able to just absolutly destroy with cabal therapy,
572950609477632021,2019-05-01 01:01:10.207000+00:00,that honestly does seem like one of the greatest strengths of legacy dredge,
572950502405308446,2019-05-01 01:00:44.679000+00:00,turn 2 play 2 cabal therapies get rekt,
572950464682000396,2019-05-01 01:00:35.685000+00:00,i was just like,
572950425578504203,2019-05-01 01:00:26.362000+00:00,i liked playing legacy dredge,
572950364123562026,2019-05-01 01:00:11.710000+00:00,y would u try to bully small formats,
572950293600403476,2019-05-01 00:59:54.896000+00:00,vintage is neat,
572949984820068363,2019-05-01 00:58:41.277000+00:00,so theres no format less lame to play,
572949934664450068,2019-05-01 00:58:29.319000+00:00,but i dont play standard,
572949388805144596,2019-05-01 00:56:19.176000+00:00,then play a less lame format,
572949237621325834,2019-05-01 00:55:43.131000+00:00,the best way to see what the standard meta looks like is through tournaments,
572949181518577675,2019-05-01 00:55:29.755000+00:00,but honestly i woudlnt consider that very reliable,
572949136329146368,2019-05-01 00:55:18.981000+00:00,i think its tracked,
572949058805563393,2019-05-01 00:55:00.498000+00:00,i mean,
572949040728244225,2019-05-01 00:54:56.188000+00:00,idk if those really exist,
572947770097532942,2019-05-01 00:49:53.246000+00:00,and its dropped a lot since arena,
572947728733306910,2019-05-01 00:49:43.384000+00:00,apparently the number of people in the league was as low as 20 at one point,
572947688111210498,2019-05-01 00:49:33.699000+00:00,for standard mtgo lists probably arent that reliable,
572947658235183117,2019-05-01 00:49:26.576000+00:00,well either way,
572947444250443807,2019-05-01 00:48:35.558000+00:00,bit of a glass cannon though,
572947426109947904,2019-05-01 00:48:31.233000+00:00,feather seems cool too,
572947407134916644,2019-05-01 00:48:26.709000+00:00,ye,
572947149055197197,2019-05-01 00:47:25.178000+00:00,yup,
572947090263638016,2019-05-01 00:47:11.161000+00:00,but theres also a deck with 6 cards in the sb,
572947046730956800,2019-05-01 00:47:00.782000+00:00,i already said this,
572946882611904527,2019-05-01 00:46:21.653000+00:00,apparenlty no one plays standard on mtgo so dont pay attention to the 5-0 list,
572925928926347304,2019-04-30 23:23:05.905000+00:00,lol i played against a treauser hunt deck and just cabal therapied the shit out of him,
572923468622856202,2019-04-30 23:13:19.323000+00:00,its real stupid so far,
572923449022873611,2019-04-30 23:13:14.650000+00:00,idk lol,
572921374675566630,2019-04-30 23:05:00.087000+00:00,ive literally gone to game 3 without having a turn,
572921302906699786,2019-04-30 23:04:42.976000+00:00,they either win or whiff turn one,
572921281700429854,2019-04-30 23:04:37.920000+00:00,half the time i dont even get a turn,
572921251002318868,2019-04-30 23:04:30.601000+00:00,all of my games have been against storm,
572921222279462921,2019-04-30 23:04:23.753000+00:00,legacy is stupid,
572912389385879563,2019-04-30 22:29:17.827000+00:00,one of the lists that 5-0d had 6 cards in its sb,
572912342061285386,2019-04-30 22:29:06.544000+00:00,actually it seems like the standard meta on mtgo is super low,

572910664163655700,2019-04-30 22:22:26.502000+00:00,overall some spicy looking lists for standard,
572910488661393418,2019-04-30 22:21:44.659000+00:00,with the addition of Dreadhorde Arcanist,
572910443455053844,2019-04-30 22:21:33.881000+00:00,looks like boros feather could be a deck,

572185662019731469,2019-04-28 22:21:32.521000+00:00,Flame keld sees play,
572185386785439795,2019-04-28 22:20:26.900000+00:00,But it has tools to work,
572185335534977036,2019-04-28 22:20:14.681000+00:00,Yeah,
572185192379318277,2019-04-28 22:19:40.550000+00:00,Devoted druid is fine,
572185089987969027,2019-04-28 22:19:16.138000+00:00,Grishoalbrand is also a deck that sees play,
572184700999827466,2019-04-28 22:17:43.396000+00:00,Yeah dredge is just super synergistic,
572184617717858326,2019-04-28 22:17:23.540000+00:00,Like when touch cathartic reunion with two stinkers imps in hand,
572184449261764650,2019-04-28 22:16:43.377000+00:00,It feels like a combo deck sometimes though,
572184204943687732,2019-04-28 22:15:45.127000+00:00,Sram os is fringe but okay,
572184063713083395,2019-04-28 22:15:11.455000+00:00,Ad naus is a solid deck still,
572183770996801540,2019-04-28 22:14:01.666000+00:00,I'm gonna say not really,
572183701291794432,2019-04-28 22:13:45.047000+00:00,Depends on your definition,
572183574770483262,2019-04-28 22:13:14.882000+00:00,Amulet Titan is one of the best modern decks,
572183410664144896,2019-04-28 22:12:35.756000+00:00,Yeah modern would be way better if lands weren't so expensive,
572183234872606723,2019-04-28 22:11:53.844000+00:00,Yeah fuck the lands tbh,
572183152672374784,2019-04-28 22:11:34.246000+00:00,Eh tefari is still one of the greatest planes walkers ever printed,
572182831623831552,2019-04-28 22:10:17.702000+00:00,Tefari is pretty big,
572182728003551258,2019-04-28 22:09:52.997000+00:00,Militia Buguler,
572182647229513735,2019-04-28 22:09:33.739000+00:00,Kitesail free booster,
572182435052126228,2019-04-28 22:08:43.152000+00:00,Crackling drake,
572182030578614272,2019-04-28 22:07:06.718000+00:00,Assassin's trophy sees reasonable play,
572180764511174667,2019-04-28 22:02:04.864000+00:00,And new sets change things up all the time,
572180637780541440,2019-04-28 22:01:34.649000+00:00,Yeah but modern has way more decks that are viable,
572180440140611587,2019-04-28 22:00:47.528000+00:00,Yeah and you spend money on those new cards,
572179929182109718,2019-04-28 21:58:45.706000+00:00,And then it gets solved and is boring,
572179880398159872,2019-04-28 21:58:34.075000+00:00,I feel like standard is only interesting for a month or two,
572179803999043585,2019-04-28 21:58:15.860000+00:00,Yeah idk,
572179031961894912,2019-04-28 21:55:11.792000+00:00,Idk standard is just kind of boring,
572178832606494740,2019-04-28 21:54:24.262000+00:00,Lel I never used the last one you sent,
572178785995194369,2019-04-28 21:54:13.149000+00:00,Haven't played consistently on arena in a few months,
572178706315870208,2019-04-28 21:53:54.152000+00:00,Mostly play modern on mtgo,
572178584874254356,2019-04-28 21:53:25.198000+00:00,I don't even really play arena anymore either,
572178469425905684,2019-04-28 21:52:57.673000+00:00,I got tired of standard pretty quick,
572178399427035138,2019-04-28 21:52:40.984000+00:00,Lol,
572178295232397322,2019-04-28 21:52:16.142000+00:00,Until I got a modern deck,
572178265721274368,2019-04-28 21:52:09.106000+00:00,And I honestly will probably just play edh on fridays,
572178171969929281,2019-04-28 21:51:46.754000+00:00,I don't really feel like spending money on standard,
572178015237177359,2019-04-28 21:51:09.386000+00:00,Ur gay,

572177858919792660,2019-04-28 21:50:32.117000+00:00,Maybe,
572177814519021589,2019-04-28 21:50:21.531000+00:00,When does that come out again?,
572177756042035210,2019-04-28 21:50:07.589000+00:00,Yup,
572177733833195532,2019-04-28 21:50:02.294000+00:00,So I could just play modern instead,
572177673959505960,2019-04-28 21:49:48.019000+00:00,One of the guys I played said modern fires every fnm,
572177584868032513,2019-04-28 21:49:26.778000+00:00,Also I'm not feeling particularly inclined to build a standard deck anymore,
572177355129225248,2019-04-28 21:48:32.004000+00:00,John made us sandwiches,
572177152179699722,2019-04-28 21:47:43.617000+00:00,Which is fine,

568605560128143380,2019-04-19 01:15:29.715000+00:00,it also allows raymond to embrace his outer chaotic side,
568605452057706496,2019-04-19 01:15:03.949000+00:00,you can start recuring lands and get way ahead of your opponents,

568595786288332811,2019-04-19 00:36:39.450000+00:00,like the normal gideon blackblade art is way cooler,
568595677593075733,2019-04-19 00:36:13.535000+00:00,a lot of the art really isnt all that impressive,

568591746309554176,2019-04-19 00:20:36.244000+00:00,i think the hate bear strat is probably the spike way of doing things,
568591686465224724,2019-04-19 00:20:21.976000+00:00,which might be a good thing,
568591043897982976,2019-04-19 00:17:48.776000+00:00,that list seems more geared toward pillowforting and then using the gideons,
568590659209003018,2019-04-19 00:16:17.059000+00:00,neat list,
568580131237396480,2019-04-18 23:34:26.995000+00:00,oof if we got rid of the ban list that would mean ray would get worldfire,

568579879352926228,2019-04-18 23:33:26.941000+00:00,lol,
568579824432447488,2019-04-18 23:33:13.847000+00:00,i guess this means ray also gets prime time,
568579696745250826,2019-04-18 23:32:43.404000+00:00,and recuring nightmaer in every deck,

568577795660447784,2019-04-18 23:25:10.150000+00:00,i guess i could throw spawn in too if i felt like it,
568577661841047562,2019-04-18 23:24:38.245000+00:00,and then a few other random cards,

568260647117389844,2019-04-18 02:24:56.045000+00:00,do you think gideon tribal would work better as a hate bears deck,

568256538268008458,2019-04-18 02:08:36.419000+00:00,im thinking it will be heavy on edh staples,
568256365072744460,2019-04-18 02:07:55.126000+00:00,i hope modern horizons is excting enough to justify going to multiple,

568250151286603792,2019-04-18 01:43:13.644000+00:00,its also got some flexibility,
568249971191578666,2019-04-18 01:42:30.706000+00:00,finale of devistation is just cast for 100 and win the game,

568249756816506881,2019-04-18 01:41:39.595000+00:00,yeah i guess that could work too,
568249643243274260,2019-04-18 01:41:12.517000+00:00,that deck sucks to play against on mtgo lol,
568249464897273897,2019-04-18 01:40:29.996000+00:00,that deck has a lack of a mana sink and this could just fetch shalai,
568249380616798218,2019-04-18 01:40:09.902000+00:00,i could totally see it going in abzan devoted druid,

568248768491814915,2019-04-18 01:37:43.960000+00:00,the fact that it grabs any creatures and can grab from gy could make up for the extra G,

568247001402179593,2019-04-18 01:30:42.653000+00:00,yeah i completely agree with you bobby,
568246760514912268,2019-04-18 01:29:45.221000+00:00,lol],
568246414484832276,2019-04-18 01:28:22.721000+00:00,it seems more cute than good,
568246392926240779,2019-04-18 01:28:17.581000+00:00,yeah i dont rate that card super highly,
568246241595621396,2019-04-18 01:27:41.501000+00:00,role reversal seems neat as well,
568246093981417484,2019-04-18 01:27:06.307000+00:00,i could see neoform getting play in some fringe combo decks,
568245942432825364,2019-04-18 01:26:30.175000+00:00,and he seems like a solid include,
568245911692509200,2019-04-18 01:26:22.846000+00:00,ive heard a lot of talk about putting him in prison decks,
568245868881379359,2019-04-18 01:26:12.639000+00:00,i think karn has the best chance of being played outside of standard,
568245835184340992,2019-04-18 01:26:04.605000+00:00,oh you know what,
568245738916675604,2019-04-18 01:25:41.653000+00:00,i think boar god will get tested out in modern but im not confident it will work,
568245568774733827,2019-04-18 01:25:01.088000+00:00,honestly i could see kefnet getting tested out a bit,
568245356027052033,2019-04-18 01:24:10.365000+00:00,but its probably just worse than what already exists,
568245303531143180,2019-04-18 01:23:57.849000+00:00,blast zone seems like it has potentila,
568244858431602736,2019-04-18 01:22:11.729000+00:00,if we're talking about non standard formats,
568244828555444235,2019-04-18 01:22:04.606000+00:00,so far i think finale of destination looks like one of the more playable cards in the set,
568244667230060545,2019-04-18 01:21:26.143000+00:00,yeah that seems like a fair assesment,
568238500315398145,2019-04-18 00:56:55.836000+00:00,interesting,
568236404962754610,2019-04-18 00:48:36.265000+00:00,u building feather?,
568236391360757771,2019-04-18 00:48:33.022000+00:00,:0,
568236271227502612,2019-04-18 00:48:04.380000+00:00,?,
568235964229615626,2019-04-18 00:46:51.186000+00:00,and there are only 7 gids,
568235944487157770,2019-04-18 00:46:46.479000+00:00,they're still great on normal creatures,
568235918729936945,2019-04-18 00:46:40.338000+00:00,i mean,
568235753415507990,2019-04-18 00:46:00.924000+00:00,eh,
568235711262621698,2019-04-18 00:45:50.874000+00:00,😦,
568235635857424385,2019-04-18 00:45:32.896000+00:00,how can i build mono white without every $10+ equpiment in existance?,
568235440482549790,2019-04-18 00:44:46.315000+00:00,cuz swards,
568235423718178836,2019-04-18 00:44:42.318000+00:00,and its always this expensive,
568235387672199168,2019-04-18 00:44:33.724000+00:00,yeah this is not the first time ive built a mono white commander,
568235133325541397,2019-04-18 00:43:33.083000+00:00,who knew mono white could get so expensive,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/568235133325541396/unknown.png
568232829948002304,2019-04-18 00:34:23.915000+00:00,that seems neat,
568232815326396418,2019-04-18 00:34:20.429000+00:00,yeah i'll probably have stuff that saves my creatures,
568232747437522976,2019-04-18 00:34:04.243000+00:00,but they mostly rely on having creatures on board,
568232684908838939,2019-04-18 00:33:49.335000+00:00,so those are actually good against boardwipes,
568232639119753237,2019-04-18 00:33:38.418000+00:00,i mean i have lots of planeswalkers,
568232592629956611,2019-04-18 00:33:27.334000+00:00,yeah white has great graveyard stuff,
568232534484451344,2019-04-18 00:33:13.471000+00:00,no i mean weak to,
568232136121909260,2019-04-18 00:31:38.494000+00:00,and of course i need to figure out card draw in mono white,
568232094057103360,2019-04-18 00:31:28.465000+00:00,i think its probably going to be weak on boardwipes,
568232035131326474,2019-04-18 00:31:14.416000+00:00,honestly i think gideon tribal could turn out pretty good,
568225219685253129,2019-04-18 00:04:09.487000+00:00,its also going to be superfriendsy since i added elspeths and ajanis,
568225144271536150,2019-04-18 00:03:51.507000+00:00,yeah im definatly going for the soldier tribal route,
568222619451654170,2019-04-17 23:53:49.543000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/568222619451654164/gideonstriumph1.png
568222559028510722,2019-04-17 23:53:35.137000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/568222559028510721/gratefulapparition.png
568222362047348756,2019-04-17 23:52:48.173000+00:00,i have felt a sudden urge to make a mono white gideon tribal edh deck,
568089283299246080,2019-04-17 15:03:59.727000+00:00,I wonder why he did it,
568089241851265085,2019-04-17 15:03:49.845000+00:00,Nooooo gideon,
567863824129064978,2019-04-17 00:08:06.072000+00:00,i was at work,
567674101062303755,2019-04-16 11:34:12.568000+00:00,So it's necessary to make sure that does not happen,
567674028110643200,2019-04-16 11:33:55.175000+00:00,But tbf jack should pretty much win when Jodah drops,
567673907952484353,2019-04-16 11:33:26.527000+00:00,I mean it's kind of a dick move,
567673859646554140,2019-04-16 11:33:15.010000+00:00,Lol,
567666294170845184,2019-04-16 11:03:11.260000+00:00,like what u did to jack?,
567666120874524714,2019-04-16 11:02:29.943000+00:00,what are you refering to,
567666102482501647,2019-04-16 11:02:25.558000+00:00,?,
567660244994490369,2019-04-16 10:39:09.024000+00:00,yeah thats fair especially for the better lands,
567660099661725731,2019-04-16 10:38:34.374000+00:00,played him and just kinda sat around doing nothing,
567659799739629568,2019-04-16 10:37:22.867000+00:00,which makes me sad,
567659783818313738,2019-04-16 10:37:19.071000+00:00,also lazav feels a bit disapointing rn,
567659693552697344,2019-04-16 10:36:57.550000+00:00,animar morph cant be that expensive right?,
567539690262102029,2019-04-16 02:40:06.536000+00:00,no one will question u lol,
567539641281150984,2019-04-16 02:39:54.858000+00:00,yeah but like who cares,
567539130683097091,2019-04-16 02:37:53.122000+00:00,its still a budget deck with a few 3 dollar cards thrown in,
567539073544224768,2019-04-16 02:37:39.499000+00:00,yeah but who cares,
567538988491997185,2019-04-16 02:37:19.221000+00:00,and its pretty good ramp in non green,
567538936998526986,2019-04-16 02:37:06.944000+00:00,maybe not solemn but burnished is only like 3 bucks,
567538885039751179,2019-04-16 02:36:54.556000+00:00,pretty much,
567537623191781408,2019-04-16 02:31:53.708000+00:00,i could also see windfall being really good in the deck,
567537422544666655,2019-04-16 02:31:05.870000+00:00,burnished hart and solemn might not be bad ideas,
567537250787655690,2019-04-16 02:30:24.920000+00:00,how much ramp do you have?,
567537113609011230,2019-04-16 02:29:52.214000+00:00,brion friggen sucks lol,
567537093119574033,2019-04-16 02:29:47.329000+00:00,yeah its pretty great for 50,
567537046894280735,2019-04-16 02:29:36.308000+00:00,or things to protect bruna,
567537028376297492,2019-04-16 02:29:31.893000+00:00,the only thing i might add are counter spells,
567536886399369226,2019-04-16 02:28:58.043000+00:00,sometimes its just going to be play it and win,
567536853985656832,2019-04-16 02:28:50.315000+00:00,i think bruna is a cool commander,
567536800147439626,2019-04-16 02:28:37.479000+00:00,i think the inclusion of borbo is a good idea,
567536747081367563,2019-04-16 02:28:24.827000+00:00,yeah i really like the improvements you made to windgrace,
567536710204915741,2019-04-16 02:28:16.035000+00:00,thats fair,
567536406272933889,2019-04-16 02:27:03.572000+00:00,if im playing ghave,
567536383657246731,2019-04-16 02:26:58.180000+00:00,yeah im always desperate if im not about to win,
567536351956959233,2019-04-16 02:26:50.622000+00:00,its not neccesary for the win,
567536321577615360,2019-04-16 02:26:43.379000+00:00,i kind of like sidisi because while sidisi is important for the early game,
567536245455060992,2019-04-16 02:26:25.230000+00:00,i only play ghave when im going to when or am really desperate,
567536178031624202,2019-04-16 02:26:09.155000+00:00,yeah,

567536004358078465,2019-04-16 02:25:27.748000+00:00,honestly idk if jack should build jodah irl,
567535823348826123,2019-04-16 02:24:44.592000+00:00,but i was the only one doing things,

567448328837529620,2019-04-15 20:37:04.275000+00:00,unless they have a slow hand,
567448312496652329,2019-04-15 20:37:00.379000+00:00,no tron will be gucci by the time ashiok hits,
567448233866035209,2019-04-15 20:36:41.632000+00:00,probably a bit too slow though,
567448161233141780,2019-04-15 20:36:24.315000+00:00,i think ashiok could see play in more broken formats,
567447995335966737,2019-04-15 20:35:44.762000+00:00,super good for an uncommon,

567447538286723073,2019-04-15 20:33:55.793000+00:00,i think its going to be more common in super friends than against it,
567447470825537573,2019-04-15 20:33:39.709000+00:00,seems good in a niche,
567447425149698068,2019-04-15 20:33:28.819000+00:00,big hasty dragons are always good,
567446835292012555,2019-04-15 20:31:08.186000+00:00,boar boi is infintily better in formats with huge creatures,
567446732749799437,2019-04-15 20:30:43.738000+00:00,especially when u gotta buch of big butt eldraze,

567445778239455306,2019-04-15 20:26:56.165000+00:00,the only thing that has peaked my interest about boar is etb synergies,

567445239908925461,2019-04-15 20:24:47.817000+00:00,i could see it working,
567445222150373386,2019-04-15 20:24:43.583000+00:00,maybe,
567445045762850856,2019-04-15 20:24:01.529000+00:00,if the boar had haste he would be great,
567444760109776933,2019-04-15 20:22:53.424000+00:00,im just not a fan of bontu,

567444543406866452,2019-04-15 20:22:01.758000+00:00,im not too sure how the whole immortallity thing is going to work though,
567444468874346523,2019-04-15 20:21:43.988000+00:00,its between black and red,
567444249776226305,2019-04-15 20:20:51.751000+00:00,hmm thats actually a good point,

567441654143778864,2019-04-15 20:10:32.904000+00:00,i might honestly switch boar and bontu,
567441623118643200,2019-04-15 20:10:25.507000+00:00,i dont dig rhonas,

567441425776771092,2019-04-15 20:09:38.457000+00:00,im sceptical of rhonas,
567441322928242689,2019-04-15 20:09:13.936000+00:00,"likely hood of seeing play imo:
1.Kefnet
2.Oketra
3.Rhonas
4.Bontu
5.Boar BOi",
567441095789903892,2019-04-15 20:08:19.782000+00:00,like she does nothing until turn 6,
567441018669236407,2019-04-15 20:08:01.395000+00:00,oketra is good but she takes a while to go online,
567440837688950786,2019-04-15 20:07:18.246000+00:00,i think kefnet is the only one that will see play,
567440717153304587,2019-04-15 20:06:49.508000+00:00,agree,
567440230114787488,2019-04-15 20:04:53.389000+00:00,meh,
567437432576802818,2019-04-15 19:53:46.404000+00:00,eh,
567437344941277185,2019-04-15 19:53:25.510000+00:00,if we're talking about chances of seeing play,
567437305845907466,2019-04-15 19:53:16.189000+00:00,kefnet is one of the better ones,
567433158526763048,2019-04-15 19:36:47.391000+00:00,i guess more wall support so that seems ok,
567433129330212874,2019-04-15 19:36:40.430000+00:00,huatli seems meh,
567432985188761659,2019-04-15 19:36:06.064000+00:00,yeah i agree oketra seems playable compared to the other ones,
567405012519747604,2019-04-15 17:44:56.860000+00:00,She seems dope,

566468499803865107,2019-04-13 03:43:34.829000+00:00,its going to take some work since ive never built an aritfact deck before though,
566468445533765662,2019-04-13 03:43:21.890000+00:00,i think daretti will be neet,
566467866996768768,2019-04-13 03:41:03.956000+00:00,but hopefully darettis +1 will synergize well with the deck,
566467800252678155,2019-04-13 03:40:48.043000+00:00,yeah,
566467742920867851,2019-04-13 03:40:34.374000+00:00,i mostly just need to do card cutting and focusing,
566467660037226517,2019-04-13 03:40:14.613000+00:00,i changed it back to some weird daretti affinity build,
566464538732396603,2019-04-13 03:27:50.436000+00:00,lol,
566464342992879616,2019-04-13 03:27:03.768000+00:00,card doesnt seem half bad either in like an aristicats deck,
566464296565997579,2019-04-13 03:26:52.699000+00:00,flarvor text is 10/10,
566463883351425047,2019-04-13 03:25:14.181000+00:00,the art is pretty sweet,

566463640060952582,2019-04-13 03:24:16.176000+00:00,too bad the cards suck for the most part,

566462315315068958,2019-04-13 03:19:00.332000+00:00,but bobby how can it be the best when it doesnt have cool cards like scalding tarn and arid mesa?,

566449913760579587,2019-04-13 02:29:43.571000+00:00,ponder,
566449905355194381,2019-04-13 02:29:41.567000+00:00,brainstorm,
566449894970097674,2019-04-13 02:29:39.091000+00:00,serum visions,
566449808399794186,2019-04-13 02:29:18.451000+00:00,its better than gitaxian probe,
566449558905815042,2019-04-13 02:28:18.967000+00:00,but git probe is only one card,
566449521152884747,2019-04-13 02:28:09.966000+00:00,true,
566448968935014410,2019-04-13 02:25:58.307000+00:00,but you cant use manamorphose with ral :<,
566448856716279811,2019-04-13 02:25:31.552000+00:00,i guess since its 60 cards its easier than in commander,
566448420856791070,2019-04-13 02:23:47.635000+00:00,hmmm,
566445433224953856,2019-04-13 02:11:55.328000+00:00,idk,
566445430339010590,2019-04-13 02:11:54.640000+00:00,probably some broken signature spell thing,
566438706551193601,2019-04-13 01:45:11.564000+00:00,you can look the ban list up,
566438686762205184,2019-04-13 01:45:06.846000+00:00,my intuition says that decks should be a bit lower on cmc,
566437575749795841,2019-04-13 01:40:41.960000+00:00,just because we've never played the format,
566437550303215646,2019-04-13 01:40:35.893000+00:00,i think its hard to say,
566436997632229446,2019-04-13 01:38:24.126000+00:00,i should finish mine,
566436972134924318,2019-04-13 01:38:18.047000+00:00,gj,
566432161855438858,2019-04-13 01:19:11.187000+00:00,i might build feather but idk,
566432057442566154,2019-04-13 01:18:46.293000+00:00,that has a lot of expensive cards,

566058548895809546,2019-04-12 00:34:34.916000+00:00,especially in a deck that would rather be casting multiple spells per turn,

566039866136199169,2019-04-11 23:20:20.599000+00:00,and with toshi kill spells arent as bad since you can use each one twice,

566039149325582346,2019-04-11 23:17:29.698000+00:00,black is great at creature recursion,
566039093230698496,2019-04-11 23:17:16.324000+00:00,those dont do what xiahou does,

566004343757865000,2019-04-11 20:59:11.404000+00:00,maybe discard will be viable :0,
566004187561852939,2019-04-11 20:58:34.164000+00:00,true,
566004169685598228,2019-04-11 20:58:29.902000+00:00,but close enough,
566004155647262746,2019-04-11 20:58:26.555000+00:00,not immune,
566004123116371988,2019-04-11 20:58:18.799000+00:00,being immune to destruction and exile is pretty crazy,

566003157511962634,2019-04-11 20:54:28.581000+00:00,theres a turn one win in modern that involves using emrakrul,

565999316640989227,2019-04-11 20:39:12.846000+00:00,i guess one thing about it is you can sac excess lands for card draw,
565999216812621824,2019-04-11 20:38:49.045000+00:00,in edh it has a lot more potential,

565362704072572938,2019-04-10 02:29:32.582000+00:00,im just trying to decide if the black from saskia is worth having,
565362662138183680,2019-04-10 02:29:22.584000+00:00,i think i'll go with samut or saskia,
565361520536584192,2019-04-10 02:24:50.405000+00:00,she's a really cool card,
565360908029657112,2019-04-10 02:22:24.372000+00:00,with big angels like aurelia and gisela,
565360874953637904,2019-04-10 02:22:16.486000+00:00,naya or dunebrood face smash seems fun,
565360598532227088,2019-04-10 02:21:10.582000+00:00,i kind of like the idea of having a bunch of big beaters and then throwing fancy equipment on them and then smashing face,
565360478868602883,2019-04-10 02:20:42.052000+00:00,i could also just make a samut deck,
565360246290120743,2019-04-10 02:19:46.601000+00:00,nahiri is neat,

565359702209331252,2019-04-10 02:17:36.882000+00:00,if im going mono white i would prefer Eight-and-a-Half-Tails,
565359068424699907,2019-04-10 02:15:05.776000+00:00,but i do like the idea of doing kind of like a good stuff equipment deck,
565358868885143562,2019-04-10 02:14:18.202000+00:00,only problem with saskia is the land base is expensive,
565358260404879361,2019-04-10 02:11:53.129000+00:00,i think going down the equipment route could be interesting,
565357958326779933,2019-04-10 02:10:41.108000+00:00,lol i could make it samurai tribal,

565357116714647572,2019-04-10 02:07:20.452000+00:00,the hard part is figuring out what strategy to go with,

565355865960480798,2019-04-10 02:02:22.249000+00:00,maybe mono red is the way to go,

565355483372716034,2019-04-10 02:00:51.033000+00:00,that seems out of left field,
565355447960469504,2019-04-10 02:00:42.590000+00:00,niv?,
565355424463716367,2019-04-10 02:00:36.988000+00:00,yeah thats rays baby girl,
565355281807310849,2019-04-10 02:00:02.976000+00:00,meh,
565355183442231324,2019-04-10 01:59:39.524000+00:00,yes,
565354995331891200,2019-04-10 01:58:54.675000+00:00,i think a voltron or attack based stratgey would also be neat,
565354724782768143,2019-04-10 01:57:50.171000+00:00,i dont really get why brennar hates mogis,
565354691089793054,2019-04-10 01:57:42.138000+00:00,mogis 😉,
565354552807653386,2019-04-10 01:57:09.169000+00:00,maybe im looking for something that doesnt exist,
565354509421772800,2019-04-10 01:56:58.825000+00:00,true lol,
565354446612201482,2019-04-10 01:56:43.850000+00:00,ghave makes people salty do to combo,
565354407735066627,2019-04-10 01:56:34.581000+00:00,really just something that doesn't cause salt,
565351569210736650,2019-04-10 01:45:17.824000+00:00,but it seems super mana intensive and i feel like its got a huge target,
565351519470354433,2019-04-10 01:45:05.965000+00:00,i think shattergang bros are really cool,
565334026253107241,2019-04-10 00:35:35.257000+00:00,or maybe !card marchesa,
565334000588029963,2019-04-10 00:35:29.138000+00:00,i was also thinking about doing like a pillowfort/rattlesnake deck with !card tariel,
565333510152519690,2019-04-10 00:33:32.209000+00:00,yeah it is card advantage,
565333439331565568,2019-04-10 00:33:15.324000+00:00,none of them excite me,
565333398328049670,2019-04-10 00:33:05.548000+00:00,i honestly dont like partner commanders,
565333007850799140,2019-04-10 00:31:32.451000+00:00,laaame,
565332843694260228,2019-04-10 00:30:53.313000+00:00,i thought about doing a shu yuun deck at one point,
565332736827588608,2019-04-10 00:30:27.834000+00:00,taigam seems cool,
565332517041995823,2019-04-10 00:29:35.433000+00:00,ill just not make a nice deck,
565332056188518440,2019-04-10 00:27:45.557000+00:00,lame,
565331949112131601,2019-04-10 00:27:20.028000+00:00,meh,
565331164106063874,2019-04-10 00:24:12.868000+00:00,raymond would get mad at me for making another scarifie eck,
565330806600630292,2019-04-10 00:22:47.632000+00:00,meh,
565330656897531914,2019-04-10 00:22:11.940000+00:00,that seems mean,
565330550189981706,2019-04-10 00:21:46.499000+00:00,but i think that deck might be too mean with all the mass bounce spells,
565330511564636171,2019-04-10 00:21:37.290000+00:00,i really like the idea of sea monster tribal,
565330380304023555,2019-04-10 00:21:05.995000+00:00,i could make esper control with chromium,
565330152259584001,2019-04-10 00:20:11.625000+00:00,but im not building apostle,
565330123931516938,2019-04-10 00:20:04.871000+00:00,lol athreos seems neat,
565329897682239508,2019-04-10 00:19:10.929000+00:00,meh atraxa is over done,
565329875905544192,2019-04-10 00:19:05.737000+00:00,building an esper control list could be fun,
565329198311407617,2019-04-10 00:16:24.186000+00:00,hmm i could do mono black spellslinger with toshi,
565328967515504643,2019-04-10 00:15:29.160000+00:00,since i have zombies and rakdos is going to be pretty demon heavy,
565328925287252029,2019-04-10 00:15:19.092000+00:00,idk if i want to do another tribal deck,
565328531475791884,2019-04-10 00:13:45.200000+00:00,but decided it would be boring without black lel,
565328493601357839,2019-04-10 00:13:36.170000+00:00,i was thinking about borbo enraged,
565328443525300224,2019-04-10 00:13:24.231000+00:00,grenzo honestly looks super dope,
565328411032027156,2019-04-10 00:13:16.484000+00:00,lol,
565328289619509263,2019-04-10 00:12:47.537000+00:00,but i already have sidisi for sultai,
565328268191072256,2019-04-10 00:12:42.428000+00:00,i was also thinking about a tasigur lands deck,
565328204521275413,2019-04-10 00:12:27.248000+00:00,she's pretty neat,
565327839616827402,2019-04-10 00:11:00.248000+00:00,hmm but then i would have too many rakdos decks,
565327780905091082,2019-04-10 00:10:46.250000+00:00,he seems like a really cool commander,
565327759195373568,2019-04-10 00:10:41.074000+00:00,dungeon,
565327628211453955,2019-04-10 00:10:09.845000+00:00,that seems fun,
565327585924612097,2019-04-10 00:09:59.763000+00:00,is grenzo aggro mean?,
565327526952566784,2019-04-10 00:09:45.703000+00:00,fair,

565323461594185739,2019-04-09 23:53:36.446000+00:00,feather might not be too mean tho,
565323317695741982,2019-04-09 23:53:02.138000+00:00,most nice decks are just boring,
565323184140976129,2019-04-09 23:52:30.296000+00:00,but i cant find any nice decks that i want to build,
565323148577472517,2019-04-09 23:52:21.817000+00:00,i want to also get a nice deck to balance it out,
565323120643145738,2019-04-09 23:52:15.157000+00:00,so since im going to get a rakdos the defiler deck,
565322948215570432,2019-04-09 23:51:34.047000+00:00,but its like tier 1.5ish,
565322927667413008,2019-04-09 23:51:29.148000+00:00,its not tier 1,
565322907450998810,2019-04-09 23:51:24.328000+00:00,that exists,
565322896822632448,2019-04-09 23:51:21.794000+00:00,honestly gideon tribal is a deck in modern,
565322864090415105,2019-04-09 23:51:13.990000+00:00,oh yeah lol,
565322684183871488,2019-04-09 23:50:31.097000+00:00,10 of him,
565322671747891222,2019-04-09 23:50:28.132000+00:00,maybe enough for jace,
565322573836058674,2019-04-09 23:50:04.788000+00:00,yeah thats not enough,
565322410887217162,2019-04-09 23:49:25.938000+00:00,gideon tribal sounds fun lol,
565322307002957835,2019-04-09 23:49:01.170000+00:00,hmm,
565321962616782849,2019-04-09 23:47:39.062000+00:00,getting to the point where you have the mana to cast all that is the hard part,
565321655040213032,2019-04-09 23:46:25.730000+00:00,7 mana is tuff for boros,
565321618747031552,2019-04-09 23:46:17.077000+00:00,just really expensive,
565321605660672039,2019-04-09 23:46:13.957000+00:00,she's pretty cool,
565321412039016470,2019-04-09 23:45:27.794000+00:00,but if im playing boros i might as well play some cool artifacts,
565321355407654914,2019-04-09 23:45:14.292000+00:00,i mean i guess you dont need it since you'll be buffing feather anyway,
565321307823276036,2019-04-09 23:45:02.947000+00:00,wdym?,
565320694691528714,2019-04-09 23:42:36.765000+00:00,put a sword on her and start swinging and you got a deck,
565320618619437066,2019-04-09 23:42:18.628000+00:00,i think if you build it right feather should be extreamly hard to get rid of,
565246342449070103,2019-04-09 18:47:09.809000+00:00,lel i got it when it was like 70 cents,
565246263138844707,2019-04-09 18:46:50.900000+00:00,looks like feather is causing some moves,

565217232096067614,2019-04-09 16:51:29.360000+00:00,He seems cool in mono b,
565217062704644107,2019-04-09 16:50:48.974000+00:00,And I only need one voltron deck,
565216946187141120,2019-04-09 16:50:21.194000+00:00,Since I kind of want a toshi deck that can voltron,
565216840763179015,2019-04-09 16:49:56.059000+00:00,Mb I won't make it,

565216579277815848,2019-04-09 16:48:53.716000+00:00,Super easy to protect feather,
565216523157897216,2019-04-09 16:48:40.336000+00:00,Honestly making it voltron,
565216373123317760,2019-04-09 16:48:04.565000+00:00,Bad,
565216265090891796,2019-04-09 16:47:38.808000+00:00,Im might just make it like a heroic deck,
565216159914393600,2019-04-09 16:47:13.732000+00:00,I think I'll see after I start looking at cards,
565216011339431937,2019-04-09 16:46:38.309000+00:00,Probably a combination,
565202664644804608,2019-04-09 15:53:36.209000+00:00,I might brew him for commander,

564983891740590090,2019-04-09 01:24:16.684000+00:00,but i dont think it slots into tier 1 decks,

564941572852940815,2019-04-08 22:36:07.075000+00:00,probably wouldnt be good and too hard to cast though,

564933514831593476,2019-04-08 22:04:05.893000+00:00,it might just be a turn too slow for modern,
564933484305448981,2019-04-08 22:03:58.615000+00:00,in that while its a really good card,
564933457923407882,2019-04-08 22:03:52.325000+00:00,but i think its similar to monastery mentor,
564933384942387225,2019-04-08 22:03:34.925000+00:00,i think this card could make that deck a lot better,

564932988815802369,2019-04-08 22:02:00.481000+00:00,it might be what your heroic brew needs to be not trash,

564932811803459594,2019-04-08 22:01:18.278000+00:00,too late im already doing that,
564908970188341249,2019-04-08 20:26:33.994000+00:00,and it triggers on endstep so you could cast this multiple times before your turn comes back around,
564908891717107722,2019-04-08 20:26:15.285000+00:00,honestly seems insane with one mana cantrips like !card defiant strike,

563861091265019917,2019-04-05 23:02:40.190000+00:00,Lmao,
563851297174978572,2019-04-05 22:23:45.097000+00:00,But then we run 4 copies,
563850529743306755,2019-04-05 22:20:42.127000+00:00,Getting all those counters will be easier than you think with proliferate,
563849948760768551,2019-04-05 22:18:23.610000+00:00,Honestly I think it could be easier than that,
563844078744109069,2019-04-05 21:55:04.089000+00:00,I think karts bastion and reclamation in general will be strong,
563843990865313802,2019-04-05 21:54:43.137000+00:00,Lol dang u right,
563828472997216272,2019-04-05 20:53:03.389000+00:00,when do u have acces to a computator,
563828440445353998,2019-04-05 20:52:55.628000+00:00,<@!332566686488199188> i wanna play test with u later,
563827800721850388,2019-04-05 20:50:23.106000+00:00,but if dev is out they want to do the opposite,
563827757033848872,2019-04-05 20:50:12.690000+00:00,an interesting interaction i found was that with fell specter out its best for the opponent to empty their hand,
563827658094280714,2019-04-05 20:49:49.101000+00:00,nice,

563826380542836746,2019-04-05 20:44:44.509000+00:00,i dont think it really has a place in the deck anyway though,
563826328227545118,2019-04-05 20:44:32.036000+00:00,oh i forgot disinformation campaign was a card,

563824143402008586,2019-04-05 20:35:51.133000+00:00,im thinking about mainboarding some edicts,
563824097520517150,2019-04-05 20:35:40.194000+00:00,yeah thats true,
563823836479488012,2019-04-05 20:34:37.957000+00:00,i think i might just replace the lava coils with wipes lol,
563823702395846687,2019-04-05 20:34:05.989000+00:00,carnival turn one,
563823564747178146,2019-04-05 20:33:33.171000+00:00,its really good against mono blue temp and ww,
563823509705588746,2019-04-05 20:33:20.048000+00:00,at least in the sb,
563823459096985602,2019-04-05 20:33:07.982000+00:00,hostage taker could be good,
563823250413715476,2019-04-05 20:32:18.228000+00:00,carnival is also good against aggro,
563823070222090250,2019-04-05 20:31:35.267000+00:00,i work oof,
563822990710669327,2019-04-05 20:31:16.310000+00:00,yeah i agree,
563822791762247712,2019-04-05 20:30:28.877000+00:00,thats why im thinking about mainboarding boardwipes,
563822750616125441,2019-04-05 20:30:19.067000+00:00,i honestly dont know if discard is good,
563821492995883028,2019-04-05 20:25:19.227000+00:00,is it better than just adding zealots though?,
563821410410299422,2019-04-05 20:24:59.537000+00:00,chump + discard?,
563821388452986882,2019-04-05 20:24:54.302000+00:00,meh idk,
563821362385256460,2019-04-05 20:24:48.087000+00:00,yeah burgler rat,
563821203035521024,2019-04-05 20:24:10.095000+00:00,im just a fan of the card,
563821187206217767,2019-04-05 20:24:06.321000+00:00,fair enough,
563821107921027170,2019-04-05 20:23:47.418000+00:00,which is better since its also got carnival on it,
563821074840551465,2019-04-05 20:23:39.531000+00:00,i guess i already have it with carnage,
563820723982958766,2019-04-05 20:22:15.880000+00:00,i want better hym in standard,
563820693288910918,2019-04-05 20:22:08.562000+00:00,why cant this be two mana?,
563820664822431744,2019-04-05 20:22:01.775000+00:00,!card Davriel's Shadowfugue,
563820157537878019,2019-04-05 20:20:00.829000+00:00,i really like this card,
563820125380411433,2019-04-05 20:19:53.162000+00:00,!card kayas ghost,
563820106170499073,2019-04-05 20:19:48.582000+00:00,i wonder if theres room for,
563819770718453770,2019-04-05 20:18:28.604000+00:00,oh no lol,
563819636093878284,2019-04-05 20:17:56.507000+00:00,grixis is bae,
563819372896976906,2019-04-05 20:16:53.756000+00:00,the lili edict would be so sweet with them,
563819320740806659,2019-04-05 20:16:41.321000+00:00,too bad there arent any good lilis for the deck,
563819084215484433,2019-04-05 20:15:44.929000+00:00,since having chumps is important,
563819014686507009,2019-04-05 20:15:28.352000+00:00,i like chups for the 2 for1,
563818972299001890,2019-04-05 20:15:18.246000+00:00,im running 4 devs anyway,
563818949880578087,2019-04-05 20:15:12.901000+00:00,idk,
563818412250365954,2019-04-05 20:13:04.720000+00:00,i like how the discard strategy forces the opponent to exile permanents,
563818343551729665,2019-04-05 20:12:48.341000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/563818343551729664/nicolbolasdragongod.png
563818077549232138,2019-04-05 20:11:44.921000+00:00,i might have to test that,
563818049728413700,2019-04-05 20:11:38.288000+00:00,interesting,
563818039028744193,2019-04-05 20:11:35.737000+00:00,hmmm,
563817789429776385,2019-04-05 20:10:36.228000+00:00,true,
563817486047248393,2019-04-05 20:09:23.896000+00:00,although i like the lili one since its an instant,
563817426941378597,2019-04-05 20:09:09.804000+00:00,i think its a decent card,
563817403352350730,2019-04-05 20:09:04.180000+00:00,maybe yeah,
563817346238513172,2019-04-05 20:08:50.563000+00:00,Angraths rampage probably,
563817278551097355,2019-04-05 20:08:34.425000+00:00,planeswalker edicts are really nice for control,
563817236519845888,2019-04-05 20:08:24.404000+00:00,i might want some edicts in the sb depending on how the meta goes,
563817173722726451,2019-04-05 20:08:09.432000+00:00,oof lol,
563816894759567377,2019-04-05 20:07:02.922000+00:00,i think banefire is also good with this deck because hopefully incremental damage will put the opponent low by late game,
563816793924304921,2019-04-05 20:06:38.881000+00:00,i own two already so two in sb might be a good idea,
563816630350512138,2019-04-05 20:05:59.882000+00:00,2 max on the mainboard though,
563816568128143400,2019-04-05 20:05:45.047000+00:00,its house against robbys deck a lot of the time,
563816512503283740,2019-04-05 20:05:31.785000+00:00,yeah i was honestly thinking about mainboard crys,
563816469964521521,2019-04-05 20:05:21.643000+00:00,but i think at least 3x cry in the sb is reasonable,
563816392617623562,2019-04-05 20:05:03.202000+00:00,yeah the type of boardwipe is a bit meta dependant,
563816293556289554,2019-04-05 20:04:39.584000+00:00,boardwipes become better with so many walkers,
563815965557784589,2019-04-05 20:03:21.383000+00:00,ritual of soot is also good since id doesnt kill any important creatures,
563815888185196544,2019-04-05 20:03:02.936000+00:00,i think i want more boardwipes than just 2x cry in the sb,
563815840080855060,2019-04-05 20:02:51.467000+00:00,tru,
563814811280867338,2019-04-05 19:58:46.182000+00:00,yeah thats a decent start for a sb,
563814667378753545,2019-04-05 19:58:11.873000+00:00,could be just a quick finish if the opponent is low enough,
563814580166459404,2019-04-05 19:57:51.080000+00:00,i like it,
563814573619281943,2019-04-05 19:57:49.519000+00:00,lol banefire,
563814505809707061,2019-04-05 19:57:33.352000+00:00,im def trying massacre gril in the sb,
563814249596583936,2019-04-05 19:56:32.266000+00:00,goldfishing seems to be going well,
563814018268004352,2019-04-05 19:55:37.113000+00:00,i have all the tap lands,
563813814466773024,2019-04-05 19:54:48.523000+00:00,but i also own a playset of drowned catacombs,
563813736054259751,2019-04-05 19:54:29.828000+00:00,true,
563813591132930049,2019-04-05 19:53:55.276000+00:00,its also nice that i own all those tap lands,
563813414053478400,2019-04-05 19:53:13.057000+00:00,i didnt include any izzet lands since the deck is so black based,
563813356776194058,2019-04-05 19:52:59.401000+00:00,i might also switch the shock and tap land ratios,
563813225636954112,2019-04-05 19:52:28.135000+00:00,i might want a mountain or two,
563813139037028376,2019-04-05 19:52:07.488000+00:00,minus one to death and then just drop another one,
563813107336609850,2019-04-05 19:51:59.930000+00:00,from gold fishing i think the 4 dev plan could work nicely,
563813045076361250,2019-04-05 19:51:45.086000+00:00,https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/05-04-19-rYo-grixis-discard/?cb=1554493803,
563811966179868672,2019-04-05 19:47:27.857000+00:00,i think as far as lands go i dont even really need any non swamp basics,
563811592597143572,2019-04-05 19:45:58.788000+00:00,his + and - are both good on their on theough anyway,
563811523282337792,2019-04-05 19:45:42.262000+00:00,like its hard to say how much he would actually contribute,
563811488742244363,2019-04-05 19:45:34.027000+00:00,i think its just something that needs testing though,
563811380772208671,2019-04-05 19:45:08.285000+00:00,i think incremental damage still works with new bolas since he can use angraths pluss or devs minus,
563811222521380874,2019-04-05 19:44:30.555000+00:00,i feel like relying on planswalker ults is a bad idea,
563810814889558017,2019-04-05 19:42:53.368000+00:00,but old bolas takes longer,
563810734811643904,2019-04-05 19:42:34.276000+00:00,i geuss new bolas does as well,
563810698375856159,2019-04-05 19:42:25.589000+00:00,yeah,
563810585188499456,2019-04-05 19:41:58.603000+00:00,yeah just cut ravager out completly,
563810299325579274,2019-04-05 19:40:50.448000+00:00,but the 4 drop slot already feels busy,
563810263019814942,2019-04-05 19:40:41.792000+00:00,chups would be nice as a cump,
563810242585165834,2019-04-05 19:40:36.920000+00:00,hmm,
563809272048254977,2019-04-05 19:36:45.526000+00:00,just because his minus kills himself anyway,
563809243640234015,2019-04-05 19:36:38.753000+00:00,i might also go far a 4 of davriel,
563809081400492044,2019-04-05 19:36:00.072000+00:00,i also think cramming both fell specter and bolas the ravager might not be the best,
563808937196126268,2019-04-05 19:35:25.691000+00:00,yeah defiantly,
563807375514140700,2019-04-05 19:29:13.357000+00:00,the reason i like noterblossom is because of the constant body,
563807263115051020,2019-04-05 19:28:46.559000+00:00,ill have to look around for stuff,
563806850789801984,2019-04-05 19:27:08.253000+00:00,true,
563806826697719809,2019-04-05 19:27:02.509000+00:00,with so many walkers i want chumps though,
563806754757148675,2019-04-05 19:26:45.357000+00:00,i think the deck will be mostly black based anways,
563806714533511178,2019-04-05 19:26:35.767000+00:00,yeah i like new bolas for the deck tbh,
563806539668914186,2019-04-05 19:25:54.076000+00:00,i own angrath already so def not lol,
563806443934056488,2019-04-05 19:25:31.251000+00:00,but new bolas is hip and new,
563806423549477028,2019-04-05 19:25:26.391000+00:00,maybe,
563806381350584342,2019-04-05 19:25:16.330000+00:00,eh,
563805951287754762,2019-04-05 19:23:33.795000+00:00,but i think more reliable stuff is probably better,
563805898234134571,2019-04-05 19:23:21.146000+00:00,drill bit is tempting,
563805683716325388,2019-04-05 19:22:30.001000+00:00,good early and late,
563805655346053140,2019-04-05 19:22:23.237000+00:00,might be playable,
563805609221160962,2019-04-05 19:22:12.240000+00:00,!card carnival,
563805491914997796,2019-04-05 19:21:44.272000+00:00,😮,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/563805491914997792/ea166114-2f9b-4ca6-b573-1f49f7485580.png
563805378752675841,2019-04-05 19:21:17.292000+00:00,there really isnt a whole lot of good discard stuff besides the walkers and fell spectre,
563805286255820840,2019-04-05 19:20:55.239000+00:00,yeah i could see this deck mainboarding duress,
563805097167945730,2019-04-05 19:20:10.157000+00:00,the deck dosent care as much about the specific card as long as the opponent has very few in hand,
563805033175580672,2019-04-05 19:19:54.900000+00:00,honestly i might replace thought eraure with some black one mana discard spells,
563804837943443477,2019-04-05 19:19:08.353000+00:00,curve is a bit high,
563804548351655947,2019-04-05 19:17:59.309000+00:00,i could even see viscous rumors having a spot in the deck,
563804370127421471,2019-04-05 19:17:16.817000+00:00,but yeah thought erasure is real good,
563804346589118464,2019-04-05 19:17:11.205000+00:00,yeah i think the focus in on black,
563804178082693120,2019-04-05 19:16:31.030000+00:00,6 mana is just so much,
563804157299916835,2019-04-05 19:16:26.075000+00:00,i wish that card was cheaper 😦,
563804073397321728,2019-04-05 19:16:06.071000+00:00,haunt of hightower one of?,
563804052463288331,2019-04-05 19:16:01.080000+00:00,😮,
563803956225114123,2019-04-05 19:15:38.135000+00:00,with the added bonus of getting an extra discard,
563803774431264798,2019-04-05 19:14:54.792000+00:00,and angrath minus is really nice in a pinch,
563803717972000800,2019-04-05 19:14:41.331000+00:00,plauge crafter could also be good,
563803639165091841,2019-04-05 19:14:22.542000+00:00,i think the way the deck would want to win is through an ult or through incremental planeswalker damage,
563803509942779938,2019-04-05 19:13:51.733000+00:00,yeah spectre might not be bad,
563803440124264461,2019-04-05 19:13:35.087000+00:00,but he's a bit pricey,
563803419563917448,2019-04-05 19:13:30.185000+00:00,i think bolas the ravager could have a spot as a win con as well,
563803355349254144,2019-04-05 19:13:14.875000+00:00,for sure,
563803297958330400,2019-04-05 19:13:01.192000+00:00,maybe,
563803153754095626,2019-04-05 19:12:26.811000+00:00,yeah but it makes chumpy bois,
563801682752962601,2019-04-05 19:06:36.097000+00:00,angrath is also okay at protecting himself,
563801633054523401,2019-04-05 19:06:24.248000+00:00,might be able to get some use out of bitterblossom 2.0 for chump blockers,
563801558219751424,2019-04-05 19:06:06.406000+00:00,yeah that could be coll,
563796891545108495,2019-04-05 18:47:33.784000+00:00,with angrath and that new black planeswalker,
563796862633508964,2019-04-05 18:47:26.891000+00:00,I think another cool deck might be rakdos/grixis discard,
563795889219698747,2019-04-05 18:43:34.811000+00:00,but its really good against those decks,
563795860626997261,2019-04-05 18:43:27.994000+00:00,and obviously this is only going to be good against aggro or go wide decks with lots of little creatures,
563795719811760139,2019-04-05 18:42:54.421000+00:00,yeah but it also includes your own creatures so in the right deck that helps,
563791130781548574,2019-04-05 18:24:40.311000+00:00,She looks dope,
563791110674055179,2019-04-05 18:24:35.517000+00:00,Ye,
563789839544090644,2019-04-05 18:19:32.456000+00:00,Also massacre wurm 2.0 looks real dope,
563789762943647744,2019-04-05 18:19:14.193000+00:00,New tools are looking solid,
563789729582153772,2019-04-05 18:19:06.239000+00:00,I think I might try to build mardu aristocrats this set,
563789593556549692,2019-04-05 18:18:33.808000+00:00,Draws ya two,
563787595998298156,2019-04-05 18:10:37.553000+00:00,Also the new tutor can sacrifice a one drop for fblthp lol,
563787486883741698,2019-04-05 18:10:11.538000+00:00,I'll probably look into using pontif,
563787413055340564,2019-04-05 18:09:53.936000+00:00,Would probably be too good with all these tools,
563787349947842633,2019-04-05 18:09:38.890000+00:00,Unfortunately I don't think we're getting a free sacrifice outlet,
563787255525802005,2019-04-05 18:09:16.378000+00:00,Yeah,
563784859495956480,2019-04-05 17:59:45.120000+00:00,Dang autocorrect,
563784821701214252,2019-04-05 17:59:36.109000+00:00,*rakdos,
563784735042568221,2019-04-05 17:59:15.448000+00:00,Also the new random card looks promising for aristocrats,
563784615698104350,2019-04-05 17:58:46.994000+00:00,Yeah blue feels like it's going to be a super strong color,

563534426298908672,2019-04-05 01:24:37.193000+00:00,ur not a legal magic card,
563532317063381002,2019-04-05 01:16:14.312000+00:00,redirect but with splitsecond,
563523286068363274,2019-04-05 00:40:21.155000+00:00,^,
563520789085814784,2019-04-05 00:30:25.828000+00:00,i never went to pick him up cuz i forgot,
563520754575081483,2019-04-05 00:30:17.600000+00:00,Is raymond still at work?,
563520708647583747,2019-04-05 00:30:06.650000+00:00,:0,
563520101308039168,2019-04-05 00:27:41.849000+00:00,that new card Role Reversal looks pretty sweet,
563519704539594753,2019-04-05 00:26:07.252000+00:00,hmmmm,
563519569113907222,2019-04-05 00:25:34.964000+00:00,nahiri did do some messed up stuff as well,
563519504601055233,2019-04-05 00:25:19.583000+00:00,but i defiantly dont think sorin is either,
563519459818602516,2019-04-05 00:25:08.906000+00:00,Idk if nahiri is necessarily right,
563519245615497217,2019-04-05 00:24:17.836000+00:00,Sorin also didnt go back to help her,
563510359856775169,2019-04-04 23:48:59.306000+00:00,sorins kind of a dick tbf,
563483186173181953,2019-04-04 22:01:00.595000+00:00,i dont understand what you mean,
563482764205096990,2019-04-04 21:59:19.990000+00:00,lol,
563453590874619907,2019-04-04 20:03:24.526000+00:00,:0,
563452805373886514,2019-04-04 20:00:17.248000+00:00,ult a planeswalker to death and then just get it back,
563452561391222785,2019-04-04 19:59:19.078000+00:00,yeah that seems real good,
563452140840812545,2019-04-04 19:57:38.811000+00:00,#teamugin,
563452000113524737,2019-04-04 19:57:05.259000+00:00,lol yeah,
563407619008757772,2019-04-04 17:00:43.979000+00:00,i dont really think he's see play tbh though,
563407028551155713,2019-04-04 16:58:23.203000+00:00,i think he might be busted in the right shell,
563406987921063936,2019-04-04 16:58:13.516000+00:00,i really think he only slots into super friends decks,
563202141192192011,2019-04-04 03:24:14.250000+00:00,so 2 mana kill a planeswalker is pretty good,
563202105557647369,2019-04-04 03:24:05.754000+00:00,yeah i think even with all the new planeswalkers theres still not going to be a huge amount in any given deck,
563201378965782549,2019-04-04 03:21:12.521000+00:00,the rakos one seems potentially good though too,
563201310929715219,2019-04-04 03:20:56.300000+00:00,the fact that its instant speed is huge,
563201273344819201,2019-04-04 03:20:47.339000+00:00,agree,
563201246786224143,2019-04-04 03:20:41.007000+00:00,it seems fine,
563201225516908554,2019-04-04 03:20:35.936000+00:00,idk about great,
563201214028972042,2019-04-04 03:20:33.197000+00:00,hmm,
563201088648511510,2019-04-04 03:20:03.304000+00:00,that sounds sketch tbh,
563201039684075570,2019-04-04 03:19:51.630000+00:00,honestly maybe just replace one or two warboss with him,
563200779037442049,2019-04-04 03:18:49.487000+00:00,same lol,
563200616768339969,2019-04-04 03:18:10.799000+00:00,they're pretty similar,
563200592869064704,2019-04-04 03:18:05.101000+00:00,its probably something to test though,
563200486518292496,2019-04-04 03:17:39.745000+00:00,im a fan of new krenko over warboss,
563200379957805076,2019-04-04 03:17:14.339000+00:00,oh where you?,
563194615696719872,2019-04-04 02:54:20.032000+00:00,and he seems like a potentially better warboss,
563194569013985280,2019-04-04 02:54:08.902000+00:00,you werent running warboss before,

562848877858783232,2019-04-03 04:00:29.708000+00:00,i think it would take some sort of deck that runs lots of big creatures for her to be even close to playable,
562848712104345610,2019-04-03 03:59:50.189000+00:00,sb tech at best,
562848650695540746,2019-04-03 03:59:35.548000+00:00,yeah she also seems kinda meh,
562848436433584139,2019-04-03 03:58:44.464000+00:00,for some of them i think its is just bad,
562848183776968704,2019-04-03 03:57:44.226000+00:00,doesn't mean its a good pick,
562848121437159445,2019-04-03 03:57:29.363000+00:00,i mean sure you can throw any of these walkers into a deck,
562847883762860042,2019-04-03 03:56:32.697000+00:00,"""meh""",
562847869040852993,2019-04-03 03:56:29.187000+00:00,you're just like,
562847849931341855,2019-04-03 03:56:24.631000+00:00,and when i bring up one i think is good,
562847808982614047,2019-04-03 03:56:14.868000+00:00,why are you supporting all these shite walkers,
562847769312886795,2019-04-03 03:56:05.410000+00:00,i think he's great against control,
562847485807165460,2019-04-03 03:54:57.817000+00:00,although new teferi seems kinda op tbh,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/562847485182345216/teferitimeraveler1.png
562847271058669571,2019-04-03 03:54:06.617000+00:00,like I think tibalt would be super playable if he was RR instead,
562847224040783872,2019-04-03 03:53:55.407000+00:00,i mean a big reason a lot of these walkers arent very good is because they cost a lot,
562847062610411531,2019-04-03 03:53:16.919000+00:00,the one that gains you a life every turn,
562847037100654592,2019-04-03 03:53:10.837000+00:00,i might honestly run the black common instead,
562846732627738627,2019-04-03 03:51:58.245000+00:00,f u,
562846637429620736,2019-04-03 03:51:35.548000+00:00,you also take a damage,

562846553287557120,2019-04-03 03:51:15.487000+00:00,and you can only do it twice,
562846447939092502,2019-04-03 03:50:50.370000+00:00,5 mana,
562846312270397460,2019-04-03 03:50:18.024000+00:00,but ob nixilis is just shit,
562846292242595852,2019-04-03 03:50:13.249000+00:00,tibalt honestly isnt that bad just a little over costed,

562845971441254411,2019-04-03 03:48:56.764000+00:00,they should print atraxa in horizon,

562844248043683843,2019-04-03 03:42:05.874000+00:00,yeah it might slot into desperate wearwolf tribal decks,
562844112647356426,2019-04-03 03:41:33.593000+00:00,and it can die,
562844097505918976,2019-04-03 03:41:29.983000+00:00,since you can only minus it once per turn,

561197622820601868,2019-03-29 14:38:59.828000+00:00,yeah thats why im going to cobbelstone,
561196117253947423,2019-03-29 14:33:00.873000+00:00,unless we just go to rays instead,
561196091220164619,2019-03-29 14:32:54.666000+00:00,ill be at cobbelstone after work,
561196072849113100,2019-03-29 14:32:50.286000+00:00,yup,
560939829098053672,2019-03-28 21:34:37.015000+00:00,brennar is the reason i pumped up the amount of removal in my deck lol,
560900676452876308,2019-03-28 18:59:02.297000+00:00,a 7 mana 4/4 is very balanced,
560900644597137409,2019-03-28 18:58:54.702000+00:00,yes,
560898155122786315,2019-03-28 18:49:01.165000+00:00,like boonweaver giant,
560898140740255754,2019-03-28 18:48:57.736000+00:00,dont worry i only orderd fair cards for him,
560898021228019722,2019-03-28 18:48:29.242000+00:00,yeet ghave 2.0 is here,
560872591783362560,2019-03-28 17:07:26.390000+00:00,i guess i just like making it so my opponents cant do things,
560872534124527616,2019-03-28 17:07:12.643000+00:00,i had a lot of fun playing it,
560871542414901263,2019-03-28 17:03:16.201000+00:00,indeed,
560870286023458856,2019-03-28 16:58:16.654000+00:00,ive never dropped a Sphere of Safety but that really contributes to a hard lock against creature decks,
560870121791553536,2019-03-28 16:57:37.498000+00:00,huge help in stalling long enough to drop the ideal,
560870071745118228,2019-03-28 16:57:25.566000+00:00,yeah ghostly prison is amazing,
560869967688499221,2019-03-28 16:57:00.757000+00:00,so it didnt help there lol,
560869951477514240,2019-03-28 16:56:56.892000+00:00,and the only times ive needed to kill a creature has been a hasty emrakrul,
560869866903699474,2019-03-28 16:56:36.728000+00:00,pillowforting is more than enough for creatures a lot of the time,
560869745692508181,2019-03-28 16:56:07.829000+00:00,"""that was okay i guess""",
560869727069798401,2019-03-28 16:56:03.389000+00:00,yeah thats how it is every time i use it,
560869663316115456,2019-03-28 16:55:48.189000+00:00,lol the deck has a lot of weird niche cards,
560869294905229352,2019-03-28 16:54:20.353000+00:00,also ruined halo is house,
560869250986934272,2019-03-28 16:54:09.882000+00:00,i think at best you move the moons to the sb,
560869216526532649,2019-03-28 16:54:01.666000+00:00,and im not a huge fan of nodes,
560869127946764288,2019-03-28 16:53:40.547000+00:00,i think the blood moons are unnecessary most of the time,
560869012183973889,2019-03-28 16:53:12.947000+00:00,Solemnity with unlife also just locks the game down,
560868571648098304,2019-03-28 16:51:27.915000+00:00,one of the reasons i tried the deck out is cuz it crushed me yesterday and i was super confused,
560868461027524608,2019-03-28 16:51:01.541000+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernMagic/comments/b6hiq5/enduring_ideal_a_gpla_tournament_report/,
560868370602393651,2019-03-28 16:50:39.982000+00:00,but nop,
560868363098652685,2019-03-28 16:50:38.193000+00:00,i originally thought that my opponent just needed to do 15 damage in one attack,
560868199353024537,2019-03-28 16:49:59.153000+00:00,you can take any amount of damage as long as you're above 0,
560868119263051796,2019-03-28 16:49:40.058000+00:00,is that since damage is dealt all it once,
560868091475525652,2019-03-28 16:49:33.433000+00:00,one thing i learned,
560867948395495444,2019-03-28 16:48:59.320000+00:00,form of the dragon + unlife basicallly locks the game,
560867863104061470,2019-03-28 16:48:38.985000+00:00,yup,
560867631658434560,2019-03-28 16:47:43.804000+00:00,the goal of the deck is to ramp into ideal and then win,
560867507905363969,2019-03-28 16:47:14.299000+00:00,although i did once cast form of the dragon with the lotuses,
560867437357301760,2019-03-28 16:46:57.479000+00:00,lol no,
560867289193512992,2019-03-28 16:46:22.154000+00:00,one more games than i lost,
560867264853835777,2019-03-28 16:46:16.351000+00:00,i did aight with it in tournament practice,
560867053607583744,2019-03-28 16:45:25.986000+00:00,ur bad,

560634498191065122,2019-03-28 01:21:20.454000+00:00,although it does hit elves,

558051114730258442,2019-03-20 22:15:53.840000+00:00,especially in an aggro deck,
558051061831827477,2019-03-20 22:15:41.228000+00:00,since it goes exponential,

553415714690826250,2019-03-08 03:16:28.349000+00:00,tis the nature of an oddball such as thee,
553415556292673536,2019-03-08 03:15:50.584000+00:00,ive always been a fan of mardu aggro,
553415528132378644,2019-03-08 03:15:43.870000+00:00,hey i was just saying that putting a tap land in 12 bolt was a bad idea,
553402909413474314,2019-03-08 02:25:35.333000+00:00,not oddball just bad,
553401694508285994,2019-03-08 02:20:45.677000+00:00,i disagree honestly,
553401239937875968,2019-03-08 02:18:57.299000+00:00,yeah but idk if its worth slowing the deck down,
553399211799085067,2019-03-08 02:10:53.753000+00:00,bolt wants to be winning by then,

553393147485618176,2019-03-08 01:46:47.908000+00:00,yeah i9 think it would depend on the deck,
553392827699036170,2019-03-08 01:45:31.665000+00:00,which is often what a fetch will grab,
553392798590566410,2019-03-08 01:45:24.725000+00:00,they wont grab shocks,
553392759357177877,2019-03-08 01:45:15.371000+00:00,i guess?,
553392740092870671,2019-03-08 01:45:10.778000+00:00,would fetches for basics be better than mono fetches?,
553392647319060480,2019-03-08 01:44:48.659000+00:00,hmm,
553392534739615755,2019-03-08 01:44:21.818000+00:00,good for mono green,

552248408518295562,2019-03-04 21:58:00.870000+00:00,and applied for a loan,
552248393611608072,2019-03-04 21:57:57.316000+00:00,i have purchased mtgo,
552248381016375316,2019-03-04 21:57:54.313000+00:00,so,
552237631111561234,2019-03-04 21:15:11.336000+00:00,i feel like its a bad article,
552237341880877076,2019-03-04 21:14:02.378000+00:00,if you have threats out or lots of mana rocks i feel like its a valid strategy,
552237236637401131,2019-03-04 21:13:37.286000+00:00,land destruction is fine as long as you're not using it soley to prolong the game imo,
552233842581438464,2019-03-04 21:00:08.080000+00:00,"i would say running a card like expropriate is lame, since it dosent require any setup to win the game",
552233641623945217,2019-03-04 20:59:20.168000+00:00,is it any worse than craterhoof?,
552233574758219776,2019-03-04 20:59:04.226000+00:00,i think triumph of the hordes is fine,
552233538163048473,2019-03-04 20:58:55.501000+00:00,"meh, i disagree with most of that list",
552233151817187367,2019-03-04 20:57:23.389000+00:00,and the other one is made up of two cards that synergize with the rest of the deck,
552233071550791680,2019-03-04 20:57:04.252000+00:00,one of them is infinte mana that dosent even win the game on its own,
552232684450086941,2019-03-04 20:55:31.960000+00:00,i only play two,
552100226282946586,2019-03-04 12:09:11.472000+00:00,i dont really think its making an improvement on mono u,
552100176660135976,2019-03-04 12:08:59.641000+00:00,i mean,
551884675363373083,2019-03-03 21:52:40.128000+00:00,I guess it's a control deck with a combo finisher,
551884595122012170,2019-03-03 21:52:20.997000+00:00,But this deck seems a bit split in what it wants to do,
551884531884490774,2019-03-03 21:52:05.920000+00:00,Idk to much about modern,
551884226740486145,2019-03-03 21:50:53.168000+00:00,How fast can you win while goldfishing?,
551875853068402708,2019-03-03 21:17:36.729000+00:00,fun deck,
551875847095844886,2019-03-03 21:17:35.305000+00:00,been messing around with izzet drakes on arena,
551868595873906708,2019-03-03 20:48:46.479000+00:00,just make a symmetrical mil deck,
551865829642469376,2019-03-03 20:37:46.958000+00:00,but no way we see force,
551865807521579028,2019-03-03 20:37:41.684000+00:00,counterspell is a good candidate,
551865718325379074,2019-03-03 20:37:20.418000+00:00,that would just make modern legacy lite,
551865690869727247,2019-03-03 20:37:13.872000+00:00,lmao,
551859322615889930,2019-03-03 20:11:55.562000+00:00,when splinter twin gets unbanned you'll already have everything you need,
551859249454776320,2019-03-03 20:11:38.119000+00:00,but hey,

551858969342116034,2019-03-03 20:10:31.335000+00:00,you can always try renting the cards on mtgo to do play testing,
551858914099200020,2019-03-03 20:10:18.164000+00:00,i mean i commend you for trying to make your own deck,
551858391476338710,2019-03-03 20:08:13.561000+00:00,nah there are plenty of solitaire combo decks,

551853649416945711,2019-03-03 19:49:22.966000+00:00,they should reprint them,
551853422047920139,2019-03-03 19:48:28.757000+00:00,why is it so much more expensive than other fetches?,

551238419456589825,2019-03-02 03:04:40.713000+00:00,i wanna fite it,

551238008687558681,2019-03-02 03:03:02.778000+00:00,so i played with him too,
551237985148993536,2019-03-02 03:02:57.166000+00:00,and then Robby begged for death since he is also smart,
551237943025729536,2019-03-02 03:02:47.123000+00:00,Eric quit since he's smart and i played with him,
551237885224026112,2019-03-02 03:02:33.342000+00:00,it kinda sucked since i wanted to play and showed up an hour into the game,
551237817372770305,2019-03-02 03:02:17.165000+00:00,they took like 3 hours,
551237617518116884,2019-03-02 03:01:29.516000+00:00,so the game should be shorter overall,
551237598291689483,2019-03-02 03:01:24.932000+00:00,equally,
551237570307031041,2019-03-02 03:01:18.260000+00:00,group slug just does damage to every person,

545407671000629283,2019-02-14 00:55:21.951000+00:00,its basically just stuff like young pyromancer and monastary mentor,

545407296730300426,2019-02-14 00:53:52.718000+00:00,im kind of building it without much of a reliance on shu yun,

545399416702369804,2019-02-14 00:22:33.973000+00:00,yeah magic can get kind of repetitive,
545399386537066507,2019-02-14 00:22:26.781000+00:00,it would be kind of hard to get bored unless you play an ungodly amount,
545399306484449291,2019-02-14 00:22:07.695000+00:00,yeah i mean once you get up there in decks,
545398372119478281,2019-02-14 00:18:24.925000+00:00,but the point remains,
545398351009415178,2019-02-14 00:18:19.892000+00:00,obviously whole life is an exaggeration,

545061216398344192,2019-02-13 01:58:40.737000+00:00,lands are usually not cheap either,

545053230703443970,2019-02-13 01:26:56.799000+00:00,use mtggoldfish or tappedout,
545053210612727827,2019-02-13 01:26:52.009000+00:00,oh dont build the deck in untapped,
545053107814662144,2019-02-13 01:26:27.500000+00:00,he's pretty cool,
545053053150167059,2019-02-13 01:26:14.467000+00:00,he wasnt too high up on my list,
545053016915574796,2019-02-13 01:26:05.828000+00:00,nah thats fine,
545052599393714177,2019-02-13 01:24:26.283000+00:00,ive been considering him as a commander for a while,
545052560680026135,2019-02-13 01:24:17.053000+00:00,yeah brudiclad is pretty sweet,
545052347227832320,2019-02-13 01:23:26.162000+00:00,hmm yeah that could be good,
545051997011968011,2019-02-13 01:22:02.664000+00:00,yeah i'd worry about the landbase last,
545051888857513994,2019-02-13 01:21:36.878000+00:00,since you're making a 2 color deck you'll probably want a fair amount of utility lands,
545051813389533204,2019-02-13 01:21:18.885000+00:00,usually you want 37 lands total,
545051783999914004,2019-02-13 01:21:11.878000+00:00,depends on what cards you have in the deck,
545050859353145344,2019-02-13 01:17:31.425000+00:00,lol,
545050808211734568,2019-02-13 01:17:19.232000+00:00,but blue and red are good with artifacts,
545050729312813056,2019-02-13 01:17:00.421000+00:00,so is white,
545050554259472384,2019-02-13 01:16:18.685000+00:00,so?,
545050309828018196,2019-02-13 01:15:20.408000+00:00,he's cool,
545050141594484745,2019-02-13 01:14:40.298000+00:00,why not pick something less trite,
545050119779647523,2019-02-13 01:14:35.097000+00:00,why would you want to play the most popular one though?,
545049925965185024,2019-02-13 01:13:48.888000+00:00,he's defiantly the most popular,
545049717495562280,2019-02-13 01:12:59.185000+00:00,then i sent you a list,
545049703272939536,2019-02-13 01:12:55.794000+00:00,you said grixis so i sent the most played grixis commander,
545049599807586364,2019-02-13 01:12:31.126000+00:00,pick a less used commander,
545049578156851201,2019-02-13 01:12:25.964000+00:00,why though,
545049448586149898,2019-02-13 01:11:55.072000+00:00,probably more so,
545049437396008970,2019-02-13 01:11:52.404000+00:00,i would say he's at least as infamous as ghave,
545049384887386122,2019-02-13 01:11:39.885000+00:00,people will target you immediately,
545049344663879680,2019-02-13 01:11:30.295000+00:00,and if you actually build the deck,
545049317996625923,2019-02-13 01:11:23.937000+00:00,yeah but he's a real pain,
545049138883198977,2019-02-13 01:10:41.233000+00:00,there are also some cool zombie commanders you could play,
545049018133250055,2019-02-13 01:10:12.444000+00:00,you could do a wizard commaner,
545048930786869258,2019-02-13 01:09:51.619000+00:00,grixis = ubr,
545048859101888525,2019-02-13 01:09:34.528000+00:00,its awful,
545048849689870338,2019-02-13 01:09:32.284000+00:00,ive heard how it is,
545048829834297344,2019-02-13 01:09:27.550000+00:00,i will not let you play him,

545048657993531405,2019-02-13 01:08:46.580000+00:00,he's mega lame,
545048644177362944,2019-02-13 01:08:43.286000+00:00,although you shouldnt play him,
545048618210426890,2019-02-13 01:08:37.095000+00:00,one of the meanest commanders of all time,

545047565641580547,2019-02-13 01:04:26.143000+00:00,the answer is obvious,

545046674763022337,2019-02-13 01:00:53.741000+00:00,zendikar resurgant is cheaper,
545046633482682369,2019-02-13 01:00:43.899000+00:00,its pretty expensive though,
545046597977767936,2019-02-13 01:00:35.434000+00:00,i guess it would make it easier to cast second sun twice in one turn,
545046543653142529,2019-02-13 01:00:22.482000+00:00,idk how well you can take advantage of it,
545046497423654942,2019-02-13 01:00:11.460000+00:00,doubles your mana,
545046185979805721,2019-02-13 00:58:57.206000+00:00,or he's just being gay and ignoring us,
545046145546584096,2019-02-13 00:58:47.566000+00:00,which takes longer,
545046135564402698,2019-02-13 00:58:45.186000+00:00,he could be doing comp,
545041472014123012,2019-02-13 00:40:13.309000+00:00,i always do,

545041103985049610,2019-02-13 00:38:45.564000+00:00,he's probably in a game,
545040995390193725,2019-02-13 00:38:19.673000+00:00,what a coincidence,

Players will not sideboard between games, though they may submit a sideboard (for cards such as Mastermind’s Acquisition). Players can submit two different decks, two of the same archetype with different cards in both, or the exact same deck twice. Have at it!

Match play will take place using both of each players' submitted decks. Matches will be conducted as follows:

Game 1

Which deck each player plays and who goes first will be determined randomly.
Game 2

In the second game, players will use the deck that they didn't play in Game 1.
The player who went second in Game 1 now goes first.
Game 3 (if necessary)

Each player selects one of their two Standard decks to play for the third game.
Then the player who goes first in this game is determined at random.",

538863662564114442,2019-01-26 23:31:48.758000+00:00,but common,
538863652242194443,2019-01-26 23:31:46.297000+00:00,i know he probably thought jimmy was just going to keep locking down,
538863407655419904,2019-01-26 23:30:47.983000+00:00,he could have taken down planar bridge,
538863359102025728,2019-01-26 23:30:36.407000+00:00,im annoyed with dj too,
538863064192122900,2019-01-26 23:29:26.095000+00:00,game was too quick do to planar bridge and expropriate,
538863015718813696,2019-01-26 23:29:14.538000+00:00,but idk,
538862996462501918,2019-01-26 23:29:09.947000+00:00,like thats kind of what he was doing at first,
538862964577402880,2019-01-26 23:29:02.345000+00:00,i just figured it would be more of a board lockdown,
538862932973322252,2019-01-26 23:28:54.810000+00:00,true,
538862843769126913,2019-01-26 23:28:33.542000+00:00,his commander did next to nothing,
538862792371863593,2019-01-26 23:28:21.288000+00:00,like its just some op cards,
538862768158146560,2019-01-26 23:28:15.515000+00:00,I feel like jimmy shouldnt have made his deck like that,
538862647924228127,2019-01-26 23:27:46.849000+00:00,its just stupid,

538463018258792468,2019-01-25 20:59:47.712000+00:00,😮,
538462431152832513,2019-01-25 20:57:27.735000+00:00,yeah that sounds about right,
538455874079817730,2019-01-25 20:31:24.407000+00:00,its def worse in modern but i still like it,
538455513126535178,2019-01-25 20:29:58.349000+00:00,yeah i saw monastery mentor in a friends legacy deck and it looked sweet,
538452885239889920,2019-01-25 20:19:31.812000+00:00,i kinda want to buy it,
538452861680353321,2019-01-25 20:19:26.195000+00:00,this is a budget deck so theres a lot of room for upgrades,
538452775873544193,2019-01-25 20:19:05.737000+00:00,Monastery Mentor especially seems dope,
538452709808799754,2019-01-25 20:18:49.986000+00:00,but i thought this deck looked pretty cool,
538452655521923073,2019-01-25 20:18:37.043000+00:00,and its actually the first time ive wanted to build a deck in WU,
538452454405046307,2019-01-25 20:17:49.093000+00:00,I was browsing mtg goldfish when i came across it,
538452385018675200,2019-01-25 20:17:32.550000+00:00,https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/870008#paper,
538452382758076437,2019-01-25 20:17:32.011000+00:00,<@!242014433365196810> what do you think of this deck for modern?,
538439989004861450,2019-01-25 19:28:17.110000+00:00,if go ill be there later,
538439966716592137,2019-01-25 19:28:11.796000+00:00,i think like 5:30 or 6:30,
538435544485724160,2019-01-25 19:10:37.454000+00:00,if roads are bad,
538435518338433063,2019-01-25 19:10:31.220000+00:00,<@!392836110180548608> i might not be there,
538211391069224972,2019-01-25 04:19:55.115000+00:00,especially in decks that ramp a bit,
538211354004160533,2019-01-25 04:19:46.278000+00:00,it can create a lot of board presence very quickly,
538211314892537867,2019-01-25 04:19:36.953000+00:00,overall i think its solid,
538211226010779650,2019-01-25 04:19:15.762000+00:00,ritual of soot will kill the tokens,
538211157912059954,2019-01-25 04:18:59.526000+00:00,or that yeah,
538211121182539776,2019-01-25 04:18:50.769000+00:00,yeah you pretty much just need a kayas wrath,
538210957579649036,2019-01-25 04:18:11.763000+00:00,so if it stays on the board getting rid of it isnt enough,
538210896351199245,2019-01-25 04:17:57.165000+00:00,the counters and oozes stick,
538210836196360232,2019-01-25 04:17:42.823000+00:00,yeah and its not like tendershoot where you kill it in a few turns and its okay,
538210721616625684,2019-01-25 04:17:15.505000+00:00,which might just be good enough,
538210698849812500,2019-01-25 04:17:10.077000+00:00,its basically a better tendershoot dryad,
538210630038192128,2019-01-25 04:16:53.671000+00:00,i think it showed up in a few 5-0 lists,
538210576065626124,2019-01-25 04:16:40.803000+00:00,yeah it really went up,
538192918046048297,2019-01-25 03:06:30.803000+00:00,i guess im thinking with too much with a standard mindset though,
538192856188452874,2019-01-25 03:06:16.055000+00:00,idk WWBB just seems a bit hard with more than 2 colors,
538192743126794240,2019-01-25 03:05:49.099000+00:00,yeah thats probably true,
538187817755607050,2019-01-25 02:46:14.799000+00:00,probably too hard for 3+ color though,
538187765632860160,2019-01-25 02:46:02.372000+00:00,kayas wrath is very good for orzhov,
538187667674890261,2019-01-25 02:45:39.017000+00:00,id totaly make ooze triba;l,

538108530117312523,2019-01-24 21:31:11.153000+00:00,it depends on the match up,
538108426522198037,2019-01-24 21:30:46.454000+00:00,tajic is very good against burn,
538108364702613508,2019-01-24 21:30:31.715000+00:00,like people dont run adanto on arena because of it,
538108313569853440,2019-01-24 21:30:19.524000+00:00,and adanto is bad against burn,

534559417824182274,2019-01-15 02:28:16.843000+00:00,i think modern is cheaper long term than standard,

534557004790890541,2019-01-15 02:18:41.531000+00:00,theres no point in talking about which one is better,
534556938394927144,2019-01-15 02:18:25.701000+00:00,they go in diffrent decks,
534556920569135135,2019-01-15 02:18:21.451000+00:00,guys,
534554238622367764,2019-01-15 02:07:42.025000+00:00,cuz its good,
534553888431407105,2019-01-15 02:06:18.533000+00:00,im talking about the fact that its easy to get rid of,
534553824094978048,2019-01-15 02:06:03.194000+00:00,im not talking about that,
534553764657627136,2019-01-15 02:05:49.023000+00:00,tendorshoot is always a 2/2,
534553740460556298,2019-01-15 02:05:43.254000+00:00,not really,
534553595228454918,2019-01-15 02:05:08.628000+00:00,ooze is a bit better,
534553572868882442,2019-01-15 02:05:03.297000+00:00,tendorshoot is suuper weak,
534553496780013578,2019-01-15 02:04:45.156000+00:00,i think ooze is better,
534553479218462720,2019-01-15 02:04:40.969000+00:00,yeah but they die to removalk,
534553427481591839,2019-01-15 02:04:28.634000+00:00,i think if you can get that engine running right away it might be something,
534553322099572737,2019-01-15 02:04:03.509000+00:00,6 mana to die immidiatly,
534553258765582336,2019-01-15 02:03:48.409000+00:00,same with tendershoot,
534552656497213450,2019-01-15 02:01:24.817000+00:00,and then ulting his ajani,
534552641716355083,2019-01-15 02:01:21.293000+00:00,and then stealing his ajani,
534552619415240705,2019-01-15 02:01:15.976000+00:00,buy stealing his lyra,
534552602336165958,2019-01-15 02:01:11.904000+00:00,i just beat a guy who ulted ajani,
534248099443376149,2019-01-14 05:51:12.757000+00:00,lol,
534241785321357313,2019-01-14 05:26:07.353000+00:00,theyre great in a mike combo deck,
534241756506750986,2019-01-14 05:26:00.483000+00:00,so while those types of creatures suck in most decks and are super cheap,
534241693231480842,2019-01-14 05:25:45.397000+00:00,like Mikes undying ability is really good with creatures that cant have counters put on them,
534241610637246464,2019-01-14 05:25:25.705000+00:00,i think a good thing to look for is commanders that change the game in really strange ways,
534239424653819904,2019-01-14 05:16:44.526000+00:00,i think having a super budget deck sounds like a fun thing to add to the collection,
534239319645224963,2019-01-14 05:16:19.490000+00:00,yeah we can play on untap and if you paper it out we can play whenever your back in town,
534239179601608725,2019-01-14 05:15:46.101000+00:00,since decks can always be upgraded,
534239153152458792,2019-01-14 05:15:39.795000+00:00,im less concerned with power level and more concerned with more decks,
534239070365417483,2019-01-14 05:15:20.057000+00:00,ariximthes voltron will be fun,

534238969236291604,2019-01-14 05:14:55.946000+00:00,lol,
534238874612793376,2019-01-14 05:14:33.386000+00:00,but i think its more so true for you,
534238811883044864,2019-01-14 05:14:18.430000+00:00,they are,

534187178763223068,2019-01-14 01:49:08.135000+00:00,tell him to not,
534187131711782924,2019-01-14 01:48:56.917000+00:00,his two favorite things in life are building decks and spending money on magic,
534187077198151689,2019-01-14 01:48:43.920000+00:00,i feel like we can get bobby to do it,

533140552598814735,2019-01-11 04:30:13.012000+00:00,they should bring storm back,
533135564590022657,2019-01-11 04:10:23.778000+00:00,if the one of is just a redundancy of something else that makes sense,

533094722026209290,2019-01-11 01:28:06.152000+00:00,like a few hours ago?,
533093657394282518,2019-01-11 01:23:52.324000+00:00,hes probably referring to the deck you posted,
532748517546917909,2019-01-10 02:32:24.572000+00:00,Its a pretty fun deck to play,
532747602119360515,2019-01-10 02:28:46.317000+00:00,the only thing thats holding it back now is the land base and thats getting fixed in the next set,
532747446552625181,2019-01-10 02:28:09.227000+00:00,Honestly i believe that punisher has tier one potential,
532747371356880906,2019-01-10 02:27:51.299000+00:00,"ill def need to do some testing, but I think this is a solid start",
532747314994085890,2019-01-10 02:27:37.861000+00:00,I just stuck it into the sideboard,
532747172110794783,2019-01-10 02:27:03.795000+00:00,probably true,
532747051943854128,2019-01-10 02:26:35.145000+00:00,I also think that drill bit could have a place in this deck,
532746940371173385,2019-01-10 02:26:08.544000+00:00,yeah theater is pretty good,
532746877402087445,2019-01-10 02:25:53.531000+00:00,honestly i was thinking about just taking out the wizard package and going just field  only permanent,
532746679850631173,2019-01-10 02:25:06.431000+00:00,i feel like it might have a place,
532746647021682689,2019-01-10 02:24:58.604000+00:00,hmm yeah,
532746615090315264,2019-01-10 02:24:50.991000+00:00,oh i forgot about new bolt,
532746510744420361,2019-01-10 02:24:26.113000+00:00,im not sure what else to put in there though,
532746477433520167,2019-01-10 02:24:18.171000+00:00,double black isnt super easy with the landbase anyway,
532746437474254868,2019-01-10 02:24:08.644000+00:00,yeah ill brobably take out cry,
532745524890304512,2019-01-10 02:20:31.067000+00:00,in testing ive been able to do about 20 points of damage by turn 7 with just burn spells,
532745436587491349,2019-01-10 02:20:10.014000+00:00,its honestly looking pretty good,

532675619683565568,2019-01-09 21:42:44.367000+00:00,let me mock up some ideas,
532675593343598602,2019-01-09 21:42:38.087000+00:00,i can copy and paste pretty quick,
532673906314706944,2019-01-09 21:35:55.868000+00:00,although if it gets to an aggro top deck stalmate he can work very nicely as a finisher,
532673803596070944,2019-01-09 21:35:31.378000+00:00,midrange i would say is fine,
532673787481554945,2019-01-09 21:35:27.536000+00:00,yeah but against aggro it feels slow,
532673532887564308,2019-01-09 21:34:26.836000+00:00,every turn spectacle is super convenient if im low on burn,
532673406643077142,2019-01-09 21:33:56.737000+00:00,even though i like him,
532673386938105887,2019-01-09 21:33:52.039000+00:00,idk angrath is a bit slow against non control decks,
532673314984951819,2019-01-09 21:33:34.884000+00:00,it gets dangerous,
532673253701976064,2019-01-09 21:33:20.273000+00:00,honestly yeah,
532673218964619264,2019-01-09 21:33:11.991000+00:00,spawn of mayham could be a nice curvetopper,
532673092724719616,2019-01-09 21:32:41.893000+00:00,I think light up the stage is probably playable in punisher,
532672784074014751,2019-01-09 21:31:28.305000+00:00,and then bring it in after they've taken out all removal lol,
532672737140015108,2019-01-09 21:31:17.115000+00:00,thats true,
532672651571757066,2019-01-09 21:30:56.714000+00:00,idk making literally every spell in the deck could be important,
532672561943805993,2019-01-09 21:30:35.345000+00:00,goblin electromancer,
532672509569662987,2019-01-09 21:30:22.858000+00:00,i might have to look into grixis punisher,
532672416644595722,2019-01-09 21:30:00.703000+00:00,people we're also talking about grixis punisher lol,
532672379894235148,2019-01-09 21:29:51.941000+00:00,i think RB punisher will get some fun tools,
532672202986749952,2019-01-09 21:29:09.763000+00:00,lol,
532671799322869772,2019-01-09 21:27:33.522000+00:00,goblin electromancer enables wizards lightning and one R lightning strike,
532671683216146435,2019-01-09 21:27:05.840000+00:00,also reddit has told me that 12 bolt is possible in standard,
532671600059875371,2019-01-09 21:26:46.014000+00:00,mana bases will be lots of math,
532671311827304449,2019-01-09 21:25:37.294000+00:00,"oh its two other, turn 3 doom boi might not be that easy lol",
532671214813184040,2019-01-09 21:25:14.164000+00:00,or more likely a 6 drop on turn 4,
532671160362467344,2019-01-09 21:25:01.182000+00:00,like getting a 5 drop in turn 3?,
532671009443282947,2019-01-09 21:24:25.200000+00:00,it looks a bit better,
532670994574213121,2019-01-09 21:24:21.655000+00:00,honestly if you look at her as more of a phyrexian tower lite,
532670759974207499,2019-01-09 21:23:25.722000+00:00,like the mana base shouldnt be too too hard,
532670708841709568,2019-01-09 21:23:13.531000+00:00,yeah but we have access to shocks and checks,
532670539106353182,2019-01-09 21:22:33.063000+00:00,and judith works ok,
532670519401512985,2019-01-09 21:22:28.365000+00:00,there are a few slower sacers,
532670379177541644,2019-01-09 21:21:54.933000+00:00,im not sure if it really has enough going for it without a straightforward sac outlet,
532670318372716554,2019-01-09 21:21:40.436000+00:00,mardu aristocrats is still looking like a tier 2 deck,
532670094363459585,2019-01-09 21:20:47.028000+00:00,imo,
532670073060458496,2019-01-09 21:20:41.949000+00:00,but it would have shot aristicrats to tier one if the way i read it was correct,
532670002437029888,2019-01-09 21:20:25.111000+00:00,yeah honestly,
532669799877312533,2019-01-09 21:19:36.817000+00:00,then i got really sad,
532669779622887424,2019-01-09 21:19:31.988000+00:00,😮,
532669774442790933,2019-01-09 21:19:30.753000+00:00,and was like,
532669767618920485,2019-01-09 21:19:29.126000+00:00,so i thought it was a sac outlet,
532669736958558218,2019-01-09 21:19:21.816000+00:00,dude i didnt see the tap symbol on that cleric that sacs two creatures,
532669589599944704,2019-01-09 21:18:46.683000+00:00,but you're going to need a lot of lands for that,
532669563704442890,2019-01-09 21:18:40.509000+00:00,thats true,
532669521144709131,2019-01-09 21:18:30.362000+00:00,wilderness reclimation,

532669401594593281,2019-01-09 21:18:01.859000+00:00,and just using that a few times,
532669378810871819,2019-01-09 21:17:56.427000+00:00,imagine being esper control,
532669358464565280,2019-01-09 21:17:51.576000+00:00,lol,
532669311291228170,2019-01-09 21:17:40.329000+00:00,yeah,
532669208740495382,2019-01-09 21:17:15.879000+00:00,which is unfortunate,
532669172778401832,2019-01-09 21:17:07.305000+00:00,spectecles seem to be sorcery,

532668875846975489,2019-01-09 21:15:56.511000+00:00,spawn of mayham might be what i want,

532668709060476928,2019-01-09 21:15:16.746000+00:00,yeah if it was an instant that would be crazy,
532668314342916100,2019-01-09 21:13:42.638000+00:00,"take out the wizards, put in walls",
532668276434665483,2019-01-09 21:13:33.600000+00:00,honestly new bolt could be a new tool for RB punisher,
532415087454191616,2019-01-09 04:27:28.643000+00:00,i guess,

532395298945761310,2019-01-09 03:08:50.695000+00:00,Also Bobby since when did you actually start going offline?,
532394349640810516,2019-01-09 03:05:04.363000+00:00,they should bring back phyrexian mana since that was a fair and balanced mechanic,
532394212948312084,2019-01-09 03:04:31.773000+00:00,i also want to see kamigawa,
532394164512620545,2019-01-09 03:04:20.225000+00:00,id love to see phyrexia,
532393228503351306,2019-01-09 03:00:37.063000+00:00,ive heard people who use to like it say that its been super trash these past couple of years,
532393123259875349,2019-01-09 03:00:11.971000+00:00,but yeah i cant say a lot of the stuff they make is that good,
532393075163791372,2019-01-09 03:00:00.504000+00:00,card flavor is usually pretty good,
532391507500728320,2019-01-09 02:53:46.744000+00:00,Vraska is best girl,
532390857001795593,2019-01-09 02:51:11.653000+00:00,and i thought the vraska plotline was interesting,
532390809677463564,2019-01-09 02:51:00.370000+00:00,although I liked the boros one,
532390778119651328,2019-01-09 02:50:52.846000+00:00,and what we've gotten so far hasnt been amazing,
532390734612004893,2019-01-09 02:50:42.473000+00:00,yeah story from ixalan wasnt that great tbh,
532390574662090762,2019-01-09 02:50:04.338000+00:00,bolas gotta be a card right?,
532390530123038720,2019-01-09 02:49:53.719000+00:00,dude im kinda hyped for 3rd mystery set,
532390374979665931,2019-01-09 02:49:16.730000+00:00,Angel of Malice is coming,
532390277391056906,2019-01-09 02:48:53.463000+00:00,shut,
532382277636718602,2019-01-09 02:17:06.173000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/532382277120950296/Angel_of_Grace_EN.png
532382272192512005,2019-01-09 02:17:04.875000+00:00,also people think that there could be a black version of this card based on the positioning,
532381350326435879,2019-01-09 02:13:25.085000+00:00,but its an idea,
532381310690525194,2019-01-09 02:13:15.635000+00:00,i probably wont play it cuz removal,
532381142041493514,2019-01-09 02:12:35.426000+00:00,haunt of hightower basically gets a +1/+1 counter every time the enemy plays a card,
532381070092402708,2019-01-09 02:12:18.272000+00:00,think about it,
532381008134275072,2019-01-09 02:12:03.500000+00:00,boros angels is trash,
532380983241211949,2019-01-09 02:11:57.565000+00:00,and two,
532380978002526218,2019-01-09 02:11:56.316000+00:00,thats expensive,
532380962911420428,2019-01-09 02:11:52.718000+00:00,one,
532380959342067722,2019-01-09 02:11:51.867000+00:00,idk,
532380939863588873,2019-01-09 02:11:47.223000+00:00,one idea i've had is a discard and exile theme with kaya and The haunt of high tower,
532380686854782986,2019-01-09 02:10:46.901000+00:00,honestly ive been thinking about mardu midrange just so i have a home for angrath,
532380543783010304,2019-01-09 02:10:12.790000+00:00,ill exile they're insights,
532380476191801354,2019-01-09 02:09:56.675000+00:00,i dont care about the card taht much,
532380456826568744,2019-01-09 02:09:52.058000+00:00,i dont feel like having this disccusion,
532380215154966538,2019-01-09 02:08:54.439000+00:00,so chances are they wont settle you,
532380167801274372,2019-01-09 02:08:43.149000+00:00,yeah but they're out of cards,
532380035064004618,2019-01-09 02:08:11.502000+00:00,but still,
532380028164505621,2019-01-09 02:08:09.857000+00:00,and probably wont see any play,
532380005041438720,2019-01-09 02:08:04.344000+00:00,its still not great,
532379977472147458,2019-01-09 02:07:57.771000+00:00,and they're basically just done for,
532379958061039636,2019-01-09 02:07:53.143000+00:00,you land this against a control deck,
532379934111432735,2019-01-09 02:07:47.433000+00:00,hear me out,
532379890364841985,2019-01-09 02:07:37.003000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/532379890364841984/awakentheerstwhile.png
532379886485241876,2019-01-09 02:07:36.078000+00:00,also ive changed my mind a little bit about,
532379727026192384,2019-01-09 02:06:58.060000+00:00,Rakdos cards seem to be the most interesting rn imo,
532379522734096404,2019-01-09 02:06:09.353000+00:00,and just doing 6 damage,
532379503339765770,2019-01-09 02:06:04.729000+00:00,dropping a 3 drop with afterlife 2,
532379468334104576,2019-01-09 02:05:56.383000+00:00,just imagine,
532379410670682112,2019-01-09 02:05:42.635000+00:00,no i mean if it was just a normal sac outlet,
532379323080900609,2019-01-09 02:05:21.752000+00:00,also the art is real dope,
532379254911139850,2019-01-09 02:05:05.499000+00:00,2 drop with haste that has the potential to do a bit more damage throughout the game,
532379128502943744,2019-01-09 02:04:35.361000+00:00,i think he'll fit fine in aggro,
532378994113380352,2019-01-09 02:04:03.320000+00:00,if that guy was a sac outlet that did 2 damage it would be so broken,
532378863334850562,2019-01-09 02:03:32.140000+00:00,2. better afterlifers,
532378820976705557,2019-01-09 02:03:22.041000+00:00,1.An actually good sac outlet,
532378780635758603,2019-01-09 02:03:12.423000+00:00,what we really need to make it work are,
532378741112832010,2019-01-09 02:03:03+00:00,yeah it probably will,
532378675019251722,2019-01-09 02:02:47.242000+00:00,yeah,
532378669881098250,2019-01-09 02:02:46.017000+00:00,honestly making me consider mardu aristocrats,
532378581305786369,2019-01-09 02:02:24.899000+00:00,dude the new two drop seems super good,
532378441060974612,2019-01-09 02:01:51.462000+00:00,yeah thats good,
532378316876021764,2019-01-09 02:01:21.854000+00:00,!card mirror march,
532378289608720386,2019-01-09 02:01:15.353000+00:00,perfect for coin flip deck,
532378253176864808,2019-01-09 02:01:06.667000+00:00,<@!242014433365196810>,

532378224047554560,2019-01-09 02:00:59.722000+00:00,which reminds me,
532378144351453184,2019-01-09 02:00:40.721000+00:00,it looks pretty fun tbh,
532378089783689217,2019-01-09 02:00:27.711000+00:00,Bobby made Eric a coin flip deck with some guys from bb,
532377994375856128,2019-01-09 02:00:04.964000+00:00,it was june 8,
532377814930948112,2019-01-09 01:59:22.181000+00:00,i thought battlebound was over the summer,
532377725684678692,2019-01-09 01:59:00.903000+00:00,i want a colorless artifact deck,
532345612385910785,2019-01-08 23:51:24.496000+00:00,Kkk,
532345457846779916,2019-01-08 23:50:47.651000+00:00,If Brennan or ray are up for it maybe,
532345404013150231,2019-01-08 23:50:34.816000+00:00,I get home at 8,
532345379849633812,2019-01-08 23:50:29.055000+00:00,Probably not,
532345242460880906,2019-01-08 23:49:56.299000+00:00,This card is bad,
532345207744888837,2019-01-08 23:49:48.022000+00:00,Nah I was thinking of a different one,
532345061539840031,2019-01-08 23:49:13.164000+00:00,Unless you have other ways of getting counters it's pretty slow,
532344879465103370,2019-01-08 23:48:29.754000+00:00,You can probably try it out though,
532344834720268319,2019-01-08 23:48:19.086000+00:00,Eh I'm not too hot on it tbh,
532344649042624514,2019-01-08 23:47:34.817000+00:00,It's kind of obvious though and Wil probably draw you hate,
532344567350034442,2019-01-08 23:47:15.340000+00:00,Eh I guess,
532344337753964565,2019-01-08 23:46:20.600000+00:00,Honestly that new card that makes everyone draw with addendum could work,
532344161618100259,2019-01-08 23:45:38.606000+00:00,What?,
532343926321971202,2019-01-08 23:44:42.507000+00:00,Maybe if you're lucky,
532343887667396628,2019-01-08 23:44:33.291000+00:00,There probably won't be a group hug deck either,
532342282800594973,2019-01-08 23:38:10.661000+00:00,Probably not for a while,
532340156464889856,2019-01-08 23:29:43.703000+00:00,Nah,
532339276713820179,2019-01-08 23:26:13.954000+00:00,I go to reddit for discussion,
532338838094479360,2019-01-08 23:24:29.379000+00:00,They use funny names,
532338788723195925,2019-01-08 23:24:17.608000+00:00,Scryfall is better,
532321357543768064,2019-01-08 22:15:01.691000+00:00,Mardu aristocrats would be fun,
532321285955518474,2019-01-08 22:14:44.623000+00:00,I really wish we'd get a good sac outlet though,
532312823653466123,2019-01-08 21:41:07.053000+00:00,<@300697277503373323> new spoiler looks like a solid 2 drop for aggro,
531981674620256266,2019-01-07 23:45:14.971000+00:00,and i feel like spellbreaker deserves a spot in the 75 as well,
531981537160462356,2019-01-07 23:44:42.198000+00:00,growth spiral is also good ramp if you have enough blue sources,
531981329621843999,2019-01-07 23:43:52.717000+00:00,i would say ravager wurm at least belongs in the 75,
531981227154997265,2019-01-07 23:43:28.287000+00:00,especially if you find room for more dinos,
531981187468492820,2019-01-07 23:43:18.825000+00:00,alpha is super good,
531981138223169551,2019-01-07 23:43:07.084000+00:00,and you're going to need a good deal of ramp if you want craterhoof,
531980911340683274,2019-01-07 23:42:12.991000+00:00,just to have something in that slot for non llanowar starts,
531980840431910912,2019-01-07 23:41:56.085000+00:00,i might put the 2 drop goblin in,
531980682029957141,2019-01-07 23:41:18.319000+00:00,i would probably suggest no to warboss,
531980149290303519,2019-01-07 23:39:11.304000+00:00,i would probably say jadelight,
531980084605616150,2019-01-07 23:38:55.882000+00:00,warboss if you want to be more agrresive,
531980009515122718,2019-01-07 23:38:37.979000+00:00,what are you trying to do with the deck?,
531971315070926884,2019-01-07 23:04:05.062000+00:00,it will get very big,
531971268275077121,2019-01-07 23:03:53.905000+00:00,thats fair,
531970650752024576,2019-01-07 23:01:26.676000+00:00,even though its kind of trash,
531970614802513941,2019-01-07 23:01:18.105000+00:00,lol maybe i could actually use !card haunt of high,
531970409789259786,2019-01-07 23:00:29.226000+00:00,lol why,
531970284983418890,2019-01-07 22:59:59.470000+00:00,but i have angraths already so too bad,
531970249671573507,2019-01-07 22:59:51.051000+00:00,lol,
531970047854510090,2019-01-07 22:59:02.934000+00:00,its a tough choice,
531970029684654081,2019-01-07 22:58:58.602000+00:00,whos better angrath or tefari?,
531969978761740301,2019-01-07 22:58:46.461000+00:00,angraths +2 discards,
531969879499210753,2019-01-07 22:58:22.795000+00:00,hmm maybe i could make a mardu exile deck,
531969245156868117,2019-01-07 22:55:51.556000+00:00,i think it will just be strictly inferior to esper running tefari,
531969191746600970,2019-01-07 22:55:38.822000+00:00,as much as i want do orzhov control,
531969064617246720,2019-01-07 22:55:08.512000+00:00,good,
531968988238970880,2019-01-07 22:54:50.302000+00:00,but i always thought of him in more of a creatures based shell,
531968935126368276,2019-01-07 22:54:37.639000+00:00,idk like i think hes good,
531968896853475349,2019-01-07 22:54:28.514000+00:00,hmmm,
531968808903245834,2019-01-07 22:54:07.545000+00:00,yes,
531968774920994836,2019-01-07 22:53:59.443000+00:00,<@!242014433365196810> can i have some tefaris plz,
531968691810598924,2019-01-07 22:53:39.628000+00:00,maybe i should just buy tefari,
531968648496021515,2019-01-07 22:53:29.301000+00:00,why would you put him in a control deck?,
531968619148476435,2019-01-07 22:53:22.304000+00:00,but yeah i think esper control will be big,
531968587133354052,2019-01-07 22:53:14.671000+00:00,no dovin,
531968500130906133,2019-01-07 22:52:53.928000+00:00,and yeah with a good amount of discard,
531968460985597952,2019-01-07 22:52:44.595000+00:00,i feel like she could work in a control deck,
531968220861562880,2019-01-07 22:51:47.345000+00:00,it'll be great,
531968204013305862,2019-01-07 22:51:43.328000+00:00,just you watch,
531968125655187456,2019-01-07 22:51:24.646000+00:00,and a bunch of exile affect,
531968096689192992,2019-01-07 22:51:17.740000+00:00,with kaya as a win con,
531968068713316403,2019-01-07 22:51:11.070000+00:00,honestly yeah i was thinking about that,
531967880930131988,2019-01-07 22:50:26.299000+00:00,because of tefari lol,
531967853549846532,2019-01-07 22:50:19.771000+00:00,but ive been trying to do blueless control,
531967824533520415,2019-01-07 22:50:12.853000+00:00,ok good point,
531967438267482113,2019-01-07 22:48:40.760000+00:00,but i feel like that would be more expensive than control or aggro,
531967389303177239,2019-01-07 22:48:29.086000+00:00,like RBX,
531967354779861011,2019-01-07 22:48:20.855000+00:00,ive been thinking about midrange,
531963335957282816,2019-01-07 22:32:22.693000+00:00,it feels more midrangey to me,
531963280160325646,2019-01-07 22:32:09.390000+00:00,i agree,
531957602150514690,2019-01-07 22:09:35.647000+00:00,like good for midrange but idk,
531957551139651607,2019-01-07 22:09:23.485000+00:00,yeah idk theater just feels slow,
531957043666485248,2019-01-07 22:07:22.494000+00:00,especially with so many other good 3 drops,
531957006332854282,2019-01-07 22:07:13.593000+00:00,i would be hesitant to put this in an aggro deck,
531956928755269633,2019-01-07 22:06:55.097000+00:00,only instead of taking damage you need to do damage,
531956857753960468,2019-01-07 22:06:38.169000+00:00,honestly this reminds me more of phyrexian arena,
531956523836899340,2019-01-07 22:05:18.557000+00:00,honestly id rather pull a rakdos,
531956491301945344,2019-01-07 22:05:10.800000+00:00,its not great,
531956472146427906,2019-01-07 22:05:06.233000+00:00,agree,
531956355989504031,2019-01-07 22:04:38.539000+00:00,but honestly theres not a whole lot,
531956334724120578,2019-01-07 22:04:33.469000+00:00,i keep looking for a reason to go mardu,
531956309541650433,2019-01-07 22:04:27.465000+00:00,i wish i could afford tefari 😦,
531956269611876362,2019-01-07 22:04:17.945000+00:00,yeah,
531956006595592202,2019-01-07 22:03:15.237000+00:00,its esseintaly wrath of god + damnation,
531955972248174605,2019-01-07 22:03:07.048000+00:00,its hard to cast but with the land base i dont think that matters,
531955877520080916,2019-01-07 22:02:44.463000+00:00,its a bit diffrent,
531693572462739457,2019-01-07 04:40:26.064000+00:00,one of the zombies i orderd is a foil and i am pleasantly surprised,
531692813503561748,2019-01-07 04:37:25.114000+00:00,get ur wildcards boi,

531686985040003074,2019-01-07 04:14:15.500000+00:00,but idk,
531686961275207702,2019-01-07 04:14:09.834000+00:00,which is fine for control,
531686881763524638,2019-01-07 04:13:50.877000+00:00,i run plauge crafters,
531682199284482049,2019-01-07 03:55:14.487000+00:00,but ill probably need to add a couple checks if i want 2-3 trophys,
531682077012262924,2019-01-07 03:54:45.335000+00:00,im currently running 4 of the golgari shock lands,
531681919843434497,2019-01-07 03:54:07.863000+00:00,replacing cast down,
531681908447510551,2019-01-07 03:54:05.146000+00:00,is it worth adding more green sources to my deck to run assasins trophy?,
531671713864482832,2019-01-07 03:13:34.568000+00:00,i didnt draw enough tefari hate and died,
531671654581927967,2019-01-07 03:13:20.434000+00:00,god i hate that deck,
531669442409529344,2019-01-07 03:04:33.011000+00:00,argh,

531665959723991070,2019-01-07 02:50:42.674000+00:00,so i feel like warbooss is such an obvious choice,
531665922340028426,2019-01-07 02:50:33.761000+00:00,phoenix might have been an ok play but i didnt even have the mana for it,
531665832011628545,2019-01-07 02:50:12.225000+00:00,he did,
531664318497030144,2019-01-07 02:44:11.375000+00:00,and he takes angrath,
531664239522480138,2019-01-07 02:43:52.546000+00:00,"with warboss, pheonix, and angrath in hand",
531664200280309820,2019-01-07 02:43:43.190000+00:00,this guy thought erasures me,

531661521902632991,2019-01-07 02:33:04.615000+00:00,for sure,
531661500406956065,2019-01-07 02:32:59.490000+00:00,yeah,
531661286681870346,2019-01-07 02:32:08.534000+00:00,no i was using myself,
531661263508340756,2019-01-07 02:32:03.009000+00:00,tajic,
531661248522223617,2019-01-07 02:31:59.436000+00:00,it grabbed a tagic,
531661121690665000,2019-01-07 02:31:29.197000+00:00,light up the stage won a game,
531661099184160779,2019-01-07 02:31:23.831000+00:00,your deck had the edge i think,
531661039746547713,2019-01-07 02:31:09.660000+00:00,with our decks goin at it,
531660954086146058,2019-01-07 02:30:49.237000+00:00,i was deck testing on untap,
531660899438821376,2019-01-07 02:30:36.208000+00:00,game would probably be over by the time i had enough mana to use it lol,
531660743133757480,2019-01-07 02:29:58.942000+00:00,yeah i would board that out of aggro,
531660129725054977,2019-01-07 02:27:32.694000+00:00,lol true,
531660049378967552,2019-01-07 02:27:13.538000+00:00,oof,
531659885335674931,2019-01-07 02:26:34.427000+00:00,gay,
531659840045449242,2019-01-07 02:26:23.629000+00:00,do you want to take this to untap?,
531659813911003136,2019-01-07 02:26:17.398000+00:00,you know what,
531659718054379540,2019-01-07 02:25:54.544000+00:00,i will,
531659688354381845,2019-01-07 02:25:47.463000+00:00,if im out of board wipes,
531659671774298113,2019-01-07 02:25:43.510000+00:00,i might be,
531659563854987285,2019-01-07 02:25:17.780000+00:00,the point isnt to steal,
531659279460073497,2019-01-07 02:24:09.975000+00:00,i honestly disagree,
531658981500911627,2019-01-07 02:22:58.936000+00:00,i think the consitancy makes up for it,
531658720074006528,2019-01-07 02:21:56.607000+00:00,you know what,
531658536795766804,2019-01-07 02:21:12.910000+00:00,i think it has potential as a two of,
531658453475917824,2019-01-07 02:20:53.045000+00:00,yeah but you do it over and over,
531658390125150208,2019-01-07 02:20:37.941000+00:00,the resason i like it is its consisitncy,
531658291558744103,2019-01-07 02:20:14.441000+00:00,just steal their threats,
531658274496446464,2019-01-07 02:20:10.373000+00:00,even against midrange decks,
531658233241403392,2019-01-07 02:20:00.537000+00:00,its got its uses,
531658212211032069,2019-01-07 02:19:55.523000+00:00,im just sayin,
531657998553317387,2019-01-07 02:19:04.583000+00:00,😮,
531657866621222912,2019-01-07 02:18:33.128000+00:00,you can just start casting their stuff,
531657816621187072,2019-01-07 02:18:21.207000+00:00,and if they have more,
531657759356354580,2019-01-07 02:18:07.554000+00:00,thats plenty,
531657537800634375,2019-01-07 02:17:14.731000+00:00,its works very well at locking down the game against that type of deck,
531657471777964043,2019-01-07 02:16:58.990000+00:00,like as long as you hit your mana curve,
531657434884866059,2019-01-07 02:16:50.194000+00:00,not really,
531657218764963840,2019-01-07 02:15:58.667000+00:00,you can just exile every bolas they send out,
531657180546334721,2019-01-07 02:15:49.555000+00:00,which bye the time bolas is out its close,
531657121524088842,2019-01-07 02:15:35.483000+00:00,if that things out and you have the mana,
531657090205351975,2019-01-07 02:15:28.016000+00:00,like against grixis control?,
531657067325423626,2019-01-07 02:15:22.561000+00:00,i think profane is great against midrange/ control decks that dont play a huge amount of creatures,
531656738487795732,2019-01-07 02:14:04.160000+00:00,did you see the mardu control list i put up?,
531656693252227121,2019-01-07 02:13:53.375000+00:00,dude i belive in profane,
531656528072015873,2019-01-07 02:13:13.993000+00:00,as much as brennar hates it i can honestly see kaya going in control decks,
531656336128344075,2019-01-07 02:12:28.230000+00:00,i think orzhov will inherently have a lot of life gain,
531656232457601025,2019-01-07 02:12:03.513000+00:00,true,
531656153810075651,2019-01-07 02:11:44.762000+00:00,aggro might be a lot less viable,
531656129030127618,2019-01-07 02:11:38.854000+00:00,thats a good point,
531656117844180992,2019-01-07 02:11:36.187000+00:00,hmm,
531655959882235914,2019-01-07 02:10:58.526000+00:00,because your opponents health is so low,
531655928903106570,2019-01-07 02:10:51.140000+00:00,or be able to win while the big boi is out,
531655900427976704,2019-01-07 02:10:44.351000+00:00,but if the decks built right you should win before the big bois comes,
531655858887720991,2019-01-07 02:10:34.447000+00:00,i know i know,
531655526614827019,2019-01-07 02:09:15.227000+00:00,for sure,
531655412328693760,2019-01-07 02:08:47.979000+00:00,fair,
531655336277573634,2019-01-07 02:08:29.847000+00:00,ok i can see your point,
531654919527071780,2019-01-07 02:06:50.486000+00:00,i guess,
531654714014826496,2019-01-07 02:06:01.488000+00:00,i was talking about reaper lol,
531654464747339787,2019-01-07 02:05:02.058000+00:00,i mean the only meta deck rn is mono red,
531654432077774879,2019-01-07 02:04:54.269000+00:00,does it?,
531654102526984212,2019-01-07 02:03:35.698000+00:00,yeah i still dont know about it in aggro,

531652821603450890,2019-01-07 01:58:30.302000+00:00,and did nothing else,
531652804633165835,2019-01-07 01:58:26.256000+00:00,and then played a search,
531652790183919618,2019-01-07 01:58:22.811000+00:00,the deck i was playing used it like two turns in a row,
531652634784956437,2019-01-07 01:57:45.761000+00:00,does turbo fog even have infinte turns?,

531651220037697548,2019-01-07 01:52:08.459000+00:00,idk why you're down on aggro,
531651123065389066,2019-01-07 01:51:45.339000+00:00,although i guess turbo fog dosent really need settle,
531650998511468546,2019-01-07 01:51:15.643000+00:00,with the possibility of bant control,
531650938474070016,2019-01-07 01:51:01.329000+00:00,although honestly i think we might see it as soon as t3,
531650889606234112,2019-01-07 01:50:49.678000+00:00,bindings is almost a never a thing,

531650695460290570,2019-01-07 01:50:03.390000+00:00,im calling it now,
531650674493227019,2019-01-07 01:49:58.391000+00:00,i think RBX aggro will be t1,
531650510734884884,2019-01-07 01:49:19.348000+00:00,use their ignorance to your advantage,
531650438358106112,2019-01-07 01:49:02.092000+00:00,oh lol,

531650272313999360,2019-01-07 01:48:22.504000+00:00,goblin tribal,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/531650271831392256/unknown.png
531649928599044126,2019-01-07 01:47:00.556000+00:00,maybe,
531649812550909953,2019-01-07 01:46:32.888000+00:00,there are plenty of creatures aready,
531649726194515999,2019-01-07 01:46:12.299000+00:00,light up the stage is solid,
531649709895581716,2019-01-07 01:46:08.413000+00:00,idk if id put bedevil in,
531649578169139211,2019-01-07 01:45:37.007000+00:00,both perfect for aggro,
531649522988875796,2019-01-07 01:45:23.851000+00:00,and those two cards are really good,
531649446250020874,2019-01-07 01:45:05.555000+00:00,judith honestly just looks amazing,
531649391031877639,2019-01-07 01:44:52.390000+00:00,i think mardu aggro or at least rakdos aggro will be good,
531649304100864015,2019-01-07 01:44:31.664000+00:00,yeah it will be good,
531649251550167050,2019-01-07 01:44:19.135000+00:00,honestly if terfari wasnt so much i might,
531649077709111297,2019-01-07 01:43:37.688000+00:00,im looking to put more money in fore the next set to get a t1 level deck too,
531648972205326367,2019-01-07 01:43:12.534000+00:00,i dont need anymore lol,
531648958230036480,2019-01-07 01:43:09.202000+00:00,i mean i already have several decks,
531648395157307396,2019-01-07 01:40:54.955000+00:00,especially after ghalta got reprinted,
531648362575822849,2019-01-07 01:40:47.187000+00:00,yeah stompy isnt too bad,
531648229440487448,2019-01-07 01:40:15.445000+00:00,but the fact that i already have the angraths makes the deal a bit sweeter,
531648162331492358,2019-01-07 01:39:59.445000+00:00,i mean im not going to buy iut,
531648055158636564,2019-01-07 01:39:33.893000+00:00,thats mostly just for the pheonixs and lands,
531648021679570945,2019-01-07 01:39:25.911000+00:00,it would only cost me like 100 bucks,
531647991186980895,2019-01-07 01:39:18.641000+00:00,argh i kind of want to build it,
531647952075358218,2019-01-07 01:39:09.316000+00:00,i love this deck,
531647940020797450,2019-01-07 01:39:06.442000+00:00,Jund midrange is killing it rn,
531647548944023562,2019-01-07 01:37:33.202000+00:00,and he can close out games in certain situations,
531647515146059801,2019-01-07 01:37:25.144000+00:00,hes a pretty big target that draw removal,
531647456082001921,2019-01-07 01:37:11.062000+00:00,but warboss aint bad,
531647437824196618,2019-01-07 01:37:06.709000+00:00,no to steamkin,
531647361060044821,2019-01-07 01:36:48.407000+00:00,it works well with the new gruul card,
531647303258472449,2019-01-07 01:36:34.626000+00:00,which i guess is what gruul probably wants to be,
531647216251830294,2019-01-07 01:36:13.882000+00:00,nullhide is def more for a stompy type of deck,
531647171980951572,2019-01-07 01:36:03.327000+00:00,yeah i like goreclaw and nullhide,
531646370340143144,2019-01-07 01:32:52.201000+00:00,i think its going to be a whole heck of a lot better,
531646323276120064,2019-01-07 01:32:40.980000+00:00,im scared of turbo fog in the upcoming set,
531646197279227905,2019-01-07 01:32:10.940000+00:00,thats a pretty good 4 drop,
531646046938595328,2019-01-07 01:31:35.096000+00:00,i mean pheonix is a thing,
531640586227417114,2019-01-07 01:09:53.161000+00:00,i was worried for a while but i managed to kill three tefaris without combat damage,
531640479532711937,2019-01-07 01:09:27.723000+00:00,damn bant turbo fog really is something,
531630386925666315,2019-01-07 00:29:21.458000+00:00,especially if domri turns out to be good for it,
531630310173966337,2019-01-07 00:29:03.159000+00:00,honestly i think jund midrange might be a thing this next standard,

531560051039535105,2019-01-06 19:49:52.076000+00:00,i feel like midrange decks are the most fun to play,

531558833789861898,2019-01-06 19:45:01.861000+00:00,i think temur is going to be a deck in the upcoming standard,
531558757205934080,2019-01-06 19:44:43.602000+00:00,damn,

531558224533389312,2019-01-06 19:42:36.603000+00:00,its doing less well,
531558212168581120,2019-01-06 19:42:33.655000+00:00,testing jund in ranked,
531558136109072394,2019-01-06 19:42:15.521000+00:00,i feel like all of those colors could be meta decks,
531558103829839872,2019-01-06 19:42:07.825000+00:00,honestly yeah,
531557841383981078,2019-01-06 19:41:05.253000+00:00,3 colors going to be great,
531557823809716242,2019-01-06 19:41:01.063000+00:00,lol yeah,
531557691382824960,2019-01-06 19:40:29.490000+00:00,honestly jund midrange will probably be pretty crazy,
531557638694240266,2019-01-06 19:40:16.928000+00:00,yeah maybe,
531557620381777930,2019-01-06 19:40:12.562000+00:00,hmm,
531557406673600512,2019-01-06 19:39:21.610000+00:00,its really good value,
531557289211985920,2019-01-06 19:38:53.605000+00:00,and pheonix is probably an auto include for most midrange decks with red,
531557165316571146,2019-01-06 19:38:24.066000+00:00,i do want a midrange deck with rakdos colors,
531557042016616477,2019-01-06 19:37:54.669000+00:00,yeah idk,

531556989260529684,2019-01-06 19:37:42.091000+00:00,oh i thought you said failing,
531556872558215168,2019-01-06 19:37:14.267000+00:00,which i think is where its not amazing,
531556840446754816,2019-01-06 19:37:06.611000+00:00,although i have not had a huge amount of aggro matchups,
531556765498605588,2019-01-06 19:36:48.742000+00:00,its winning most games,
531556754626969626,2019-01-06 19:36:46.150000+00:00,no,
531556589992149023,2019-01-06 19:36:06.898000+00:00,honestly id probably build it with angrath if pheonix wasnt so dang expensive,
531556522245881906,2019-01-06 19:35:50.746000+00:00,oh fair,
531556320038617088,2019-01-06 19:35:02.536000+00:00,since the landbase isnt all there,
531556297426862093,2019-01-06 19:34:57.145000+00:00,map is probably for mana fixing,
531555998066933765,2019-01-06 19:33:45.772000+00:00,so probably,
531555990601072660,2019-01-06 19:33:43.992000+00:00,im running cast downs in its place,

531555579030929428,2019-01-06 19:32:05.866000+00:00,why am i missing it?,
531555536399761408,2019-01-06 19:31:55.702000+00:00,warboss can win if it goes unchecked,
531555500471353345,2019-01-06 19:31:47.136000+00:00,especially with all the goblins in the deck,
531555446381608985,2019-01-06 19:31:34.240000+00:00,siege commander is a huge win con,

531555285790097418,2019-01-06 19:30:55.952000+00:00,pretty much splashing green for finality,
531555217473273856,2019-01-06 19:30:39.664000+00:00,typical midrange accumulate value kind of thing,
531555116151472179,2019-01-06 19:30:15.507000+00:00,and some extra removal,
531555080869117974,2019-01-06 19:30:07.095000+00:00,instead i have some angraths,
531555058094178344,2019-01-06 19:30:01.665000+00:00,only i dont run imortal sun or treasure maps,

531551816807088138,2019-01-06 19:17:08.882000+00:00,building jeskai probably wouldnt be that hard then,
531551719071547392,2019-01-06 19:16:45.580000+00:00,it was fine,

531005379010625539,2019-01-05 07:05:47.959000+00:00,with !card lilliana's contract,
531005338632323072,2019-01-05 07:05:38.332000+00:00,probably an midrange deck that beats down with demons,
531005215030247424,2019-01-05 07:05:08.863000+00:00,along with rakdos and doom boi,
531005142766714911,2019-01-05 07:04:51.634000+00:00,is perfect for demon tribal,

531004910934818818,2019-01-05 07:03:56.361000+00:00,ill probably have all of the land base,
531004881599725568,2019-01-05 07:03:49.367000+00:00,i might end up making a demon tribal deck just for fun,

531004163061055509,2019-01-05 07:00:58.054000+00:00,im probably taking rakdos out,
531004090063257631,2019-01-05 07:00:40.650000+00:00,i feel like it might have a place,

531000066014707722,2019-01-05 06:44:41.242000+00:00,I think profane procession is low-key kind of good,

530888912961536012,2019-01-04 23:23:00.289000+00:00,which is why you also run banefire,
530888816337223686,2019-01-04 23:22:37.252000+00:00,like banefire and banefire 2.0,

530883050347692033,2019-01-04 22:59:42.533000+00:00,i guess spawn of mayham does a bunch of chip damage,

530881849518718976,2019-01-04 22:54:56.233000+00:00,but for now im leaning towards just plain old rakdos,

530619582529142785,2019-01-04 05:32:46.910000+00:00,i was thinking about argules bloodfast with the new demon too,
530619474332614668,2019-01-04 05:32:21.114000+00:00,which is why i want a deck for it,
530619455609241610,2019-01-04 05:32:16.650000+00:00,yeah flavor is real good,

530619395991535636,2019-01-04 05:32:02.436000+00:00,i was looking into how demon tribal would go,
530619364786044958,2019-01-04 05:31:54.996000+00:00,Rakdos is not very good tbh 😦,
530619302706151424,2019-01-04 05:31:40.195000+00:00,rix might just be better,
530619280257974284,2019-01-04 05:31:34.843000+00:00,although actually,
530619214365458432,2019-01-04 05:31:19.133000+00:00,god if it was an instant that'd be awesome,
530619165673783336,2019-01-04 05:31:07.524000+00:00,yes,
530619106869641216,2019-01-04 05:30:53.504000+00:00,I honestly like it better than risk factor early in the game since its really nice mana fixing,
530619030457810954,2019-01-04 05:30:35.286000+00:00,i might put sword point in rakdos aggro though,
530618940561293322,2019-01-04 05:30:13.853000+00:00,im probably not putting it into any aggro decks i make,
530618899377422338,2019-01-04 05:30:04.034000+00:00,also,

530582850718924808,2019-01-04 03:06:49.364000+00:00,maybe i should pick up a few copies of frenzy,
530582809757351977,2019-01-04 03:06:39.598000+00:00,lol,
530582450615615489,2019-01-04 03:05:13.972000+00:00,i feel like rakdos aggro has a good shot at being meta,
530582311255932949,2019-01-04 03:04:40.746000+00:00,lol brennar we all said we'd be at rays,

530298263052484618,2019-01-03 08:15:58.377000+00:00,im looking forward to brewing,
530298237744316417,2019-01-03 08:15:52.343000+00:00,i think a lot of possibilities will open up for 3 color decks with the next set,
530297867550720011,2019-01-03 08:14:24.082000+00:00,which i think would also work really well with Dovin,
530297813826011146,2019-01-03 08:14:11.273000+00:00,i know brennar was thinking about UW flyers,
530297779755548682,2019-01-03 08:14:03.150000+00:00,swiftblade would work well with that,
530297713749655552,2019-01-03 08:13:47.413000+00:00,hmm yeah,
530297648964435969,2019-01-03 08:13:31.967000+00:00,which is a good thing since terfari is good enough as it is,
530297592073027585,2019-01-03 08:13:18.403000+00:00,with Addendum being the keyword i doubt we'll see anything too good for control tbh,
530297459772096512,2019-01-03 08:12:46.860000+00:00,Dovin definatly seems interesting though and id like to see a deck utilize him to his fullest extent,
530297240007213056,2019-01-03 08:11:54.464000+00:00,so maybe you'll get some new tools there?,
530297209212633092,2019-01-03 08:11:47.122000+00:00,i do think that the new UW cards coming out will be more geared for a midrange type of build,
530297016828428288,2019-01-03 08:11:01.254000+00:00,idk about that being a tier one deck though lol,
530296964387176450,2019-01-03 08:10:48.751000+00:00,Dovins only 3,
530296883218874408,2019-01-03 08:10:29.399000+00:00,yeah that could work,

530203953422532608,2019-01-03 02:01:13.209000+00:00,i like firebrand better,

530201187006545940,2019-01-03 01:50:13.644000+00:00,yup,
530200068880596992,2019-01-03 01:45:47.062000+00:00,since then it becomes a 2/1 that does one damage on death,
530200004728586240,2019-01-03 01:45:31.767000+00:00,if we have judith i think its more advantageous to run firebrand,
530198604963643393,2019-01-03 01:39:58.037000+00:00,might just get a new one drop thats better too,
530198318958247946,2019-01-03 01:38:49.848000+00:00,or maybe lavarunner if we want to run wizards lightning,
530198195188400146,2019-01-03 01:38:20.339000+00:00,fanatical firebrand,

530197741570097172,2019-01-03 01:36:32.188000+00:00,she would be a nice curvetopper,
530197677850230804,2019-01-03 01:36:16.996000+00:00,oh yeah and aureilia,
530197654756655134,2019-01-03 01:36:11.490000+00:00,i think tajic might be the only mentor you want,
530197618400428032,2019-01-03 01:36:02.822000+00:00,i feel like better stuff well come out,

530197410387984385,2019-01-03 01:35:13.228000+00:00,i think tajic is a good pick for it too,
530197308491563008,2019-01-03 01:34:48.934000+00:00,im more interested in judith + swiftblade,

529125998084751369,2018-12-31 02:37:48.629000+00:00,Gisa and Geralf or Scarab God are probably the best for zombies,
529125849396543517,2018-12-31 02:37:13.179000+00:00,especially with phyrexian or ashnods altar out,

528780856899141633,2018-12-30 03:46:20.558000+00:00,but im trying to spend not too much on this one lol,
528780820358365193,2018-12-30 03:46:11.846000+00:00,thats a great card,
528764411800846357,2018-12-30 02:40:59.741000+00:00,curve is also probably a bit high,
528764295329218560,2018-12-30 02:40:31.972000+00:00,still need to make a few cuts,
528764082388467723,2018-12-30 02:39:41.203000+00:00,bit i already have mike and phyrexian altar,
528764055779934212,2018-12-30 02:39:34.859000+00:00,a bit pricey,
528764014637875218,2018-12-30 02:39:25.050000+00:00,current list,
528764002940092427,2018-12-30 02:39:22.261000+00:00,https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/1537260#paper,
528763866449051648,2018-12-30 02:38:49.719000+00:00,so the focus is more on just having synergy,
528763797981102100,2018-12-30 02:38:33.395000+00:00,yeah the goal was to have something fun to pull out when people are tired of combo heavy ghave,
528763680439926815,2018-12-30 02:38:05.371000+00:00,but they're no doubt there,
528763626715349002,2018-12-30 02:37:52.562000+00:00,i havent really figured em out,
528763593412444191,2018-12-30 02:37:44.622000+00:00,so theres probably some combos in zombie theme,
528763556716609576,2018-12-30 02:37:35.873000+00:00,is in their,

528763315351060490,2018-12-30 02:36:38.327000+00:00,but i have to stop myself,
528763292466806797,2018-12-30 02:36:32.871000+00:00,im always tempted to add combos,
528763250922356757,2018-12-30 02:36:22.966000+00:00,every time i add new cards to the deck,
528763170324611074,2018-12-30 02:36:03.750000+00:00,the allure of combos is all too strong,
528763145897115650,2018-12-30 02:35:57.926000+00:00,and even as im making a budget mike zombie deck,
528763059267829799,2018-12-30 02:35:37.272000+00:00,but theres just so much cool stuff that you can do with him,
528763023565914144,2018-12-30 02:35:28.760000+00:00,yeah i wasnt going to make ghave combo originally,

528748324937793546,2018-12-30 01:37:04.334000+00:00,lol,
528747681498005505,2018-12-30 01:34:30.926000+00:00,makes sense,

528745934591623168,2018-12-30 01:27:34.431000+00:00,RB punisher is fun and could be viable with the next set,
528745865674752010,2018-12-30 01:27:18+00:00,i hope we see a new punisher card,
528745290317168650,2018-12-30 01:25:00.824000+00:00,it looked pretty cool,
528745277943840769,2018-12-30 01:24:57.874000+00:00,i kind of hope that probably fake card is real,
528745225615835149,2018-12-30 01:24:45.398000+00:00,nope,
528745051791163392,2018-12-30 01:24:03.955000+00:00,lol,
528744974402191380,2018-12-30 01:23:45.504000+00:00,if spectacle is well supported i could definatly see it as a good option in rakdos midrange,
528744838615531533,2018-12-30 01:23:13.130000+00:00,i guess it all depends on the rakdos cards in the next set,
528744770223210497,2018-12-30 01:22:56.824000+00:00,i mean its fine,
528743320105648128,2018-12-30 01:17:11.089000+00:00,i feel like a 5 drop is too slow for what most rakdos decks want to do,
528743261502832661,2018-12-30 01:16:57.117000+00:00,but most of the time it just dosent do anything,
528743216397418507,2018-12-30 01:16:46.363000+00:00,and its okay,
528743199737511946,2018-12-30 01:16:42.391000+00:00,i run it as a 2 of in a RB punisher deck,
528741506064973824,2018-12-30 01:09:58.588000+00:00,the card is not worth that much,
528741479594590208,2018-12-30 01:09:52.277000+00:00,i honestly thought it would start dropping by now lol,
528741430278094868,2018-12-30 01:09:40.519000+00:00,I dont understand why its staying at 17,

528734260870512640,2018-12-30 00:41:11.199000+00:00,We should do an uma draft,

528425844981628938,2018-12-29 04:15:39.121000+00:00,gruul will probably be cool,
528411559685390339,2018-12-29 03:18:53.241000+00:00,Weekly change is like 112%,
528411490974302208,2018-12-29 03:18:36.859000+00:00,That was the daily change,
528411389040132106,2018-12-29 03:18:12.556000+00:00,But there hasn't been any notable rakdos spoilers this week,
528411291048607744,2018-12-29 03:17:49.193000+00:00,I assume the new set,

528404343804788736,2018-12-29 02:50:12.841000+00:00,although anything that puts out lyra is bad,
528404238628552715,2018-12-29 02:49:47.765000+00:00,i havent had much trouble with control decks like jeskai either,

528404076103467019,2018-12-29 02:49:09.016000+00:00,in a bo1 format the only decks it really struggels against are anything with white,

524747115134713887,2018-12-19 00:37:41.578000+00:00,idk i think i might still take the dimir deck apart,
524746938738933812,2018-12-19 00:36:59.522000+00:00,Golgari,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/524746938738933810/unknown.png
524746543987818506,2018-12-19 00:35:25.406000+00:00,also i like moment of craving,
524746413461209108,2018-12-19 00:34:54.286000+00:00,https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/standard-dimir-control-64216#paper,
524746411187634176,2018-12-19 00:34:53.744000+00:00,this build looks fun lol,
524746305696956455,2018-12-19 00:34:28.593000+00:00,yeah,
524746220049137687,2018-12-19 00:34:08.173000+00:00,i would not main deck it,
524746154789830657,2018-12-19 00:33:52.614000+00:00,depends on the meta,
524745924333797407,2018-12-19 00:32:57.669000+00:00,i was just looking at it again,
524745893958647809,2018-12-19 00:32:50.427000+00:00,yeah you probably did,
524745793672970251,2018-12-19 00:32:26.517000+00:00,i am a fan of the current meta build for dimir,
524745754921664533,2018-12-19 00:32:17.278000+00:00,https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/standard-dimir-control-60568#paper,
524745703163953152,2018-12-19 00:32:04.938000+00:00,yeah could be,
524745551074295839,2018-12-19 00:31:28.677000+00:00,lol nice,
524745396342226954,2018-12-19 00:30:51.786000+00:00,as a 2 of,
524745356160925703,2018-12-19 00:30:42.206000+00:00,if i move to a more control deck i think it might be,
524745240440209428,2018-12-19 00:30:14.616000+00:00,also true,
524745210287226880,2018-12-19 00:30:07.427000+00:00,if they're heavy on walker stuff than it does,
524745167752658964,2018-12-19 00:29:57.286000+00:00,and true,
524745148974759936,2018-12-19 00:29:52.809000+00:00,early game yeah,
524745075721371658,2018-12-19 00:29:35.344000+00:00,ritual of soot really hurts golgari,
524744972033851392,2018-12-19 00:29:10.623000+00:00,although i guess with a boardwipe its good,
524744901787648041,2018-12-19 00:28:53.875000+00:00,like golgari midrange,
524744884930740254,2018-12-19 00:28:49.856000+00:00,but against some decks it dosent cut it,
524744855071621131,2018-12-19 00:28:42.737000+00:00,crafter is good,
524744831344574464,2018-12-19 00:28:37.080000+00:00,half the reason for contempt is planeswalkers,
524744738235088926,2018-12-19 00:28:14.881000+00:00,and that seems to be whats standing in my way for making it control,
524744695663034379,2018-12-19 00:28:04.731000+00:00,yeah i just dont want to buy contempts,
524744602507542530,2018-12-19 00:27:42.521000+00:00,even tho i like it,
524744582705971212,2018-12-19 00:27:37.800000+00:00,since im kind of unhappy with it,
524744550414286858,2018-12-19 00:27:30.101000+00:00,i think ill probably dissolve my dimir for a new one,
524744500032045086,2018-12-19 00:27:18.089000+00:00,so many possibilities,

524743978256564245,2018-12-19 00:25:13.688000+00:00,idk if orzhov gets good control support i might want to do that as well,
524743706847346688,2018-12-19 00:24:08.979000+00:00,azhorious is gross,

524743208190607370,2018-12-19 00:22:10.090000+00:00,it really all comes down to what comes out,
524743154176491530,2018-12-19 00:21:57.212000+00:00,thats pretty good,
524743144185790464,2018-12-19 00:21:54.830000+00:00,oh but vigilnace,

524742997208989696,2018-12-19 00:21:19.788000+00:00,mardu demons,
524742917429133312,2018-12-19 00:21:00.767000+00:00,that would take deck testing,
524742898499977226,2018-12-19 00:20:56.254000+00:00,idk if its consistant,
524742753742225409,2018-12-19 00:20:21.741000+00:00,but beating face with big demons is the best part of demon tribal,

524740160911310859,2018-12-19 00:10:03.562000+00:00,idk,
524740081966252033,2018-12-19 00:09:44.740000+00:00,since id like to go for a more midrange/ control build,
524740033379303425,2018-12-19 00:09:33.156000+00:00,i just hope that we see some good instant/sorcery cards with spectacle,
524739611851882496,2018-12-19 00:07:52.656000+00:00,since i like cards,
524739560312143872,2018-12-19 00:07:40.368000+00:00,instead of having less cards,
524739541006024704,2018-12-19 00:07:35.765000+00:00,i was def hoping that rakdos would get something that incentivized doing damage,
524739390275190804,2018-12-19 00:06:59.828000+00:00,and it fits really well,
524739328782499858,2018-12-19 00:06:45.167000+00:00,i think spectecle is the best ablity rakdos has seen,
524739271501021205,2018-12-19 00:06:31.510000+00:00,although im not a fan of the ability,
524739226596540416,2018-12-19 00:06:20.804000+00:00,idk anything about the past guild,
524739194720092200,2018-12-19 00:06:13.204000+00:00,yes,
524738939651620875,2018-12-19 00:05:12.391000+00:00,but hes also pretty cool,
524738918646546432,2018-12-19 00:05:07.383000+00:00,the other one is a bit costly,
524738879354568725,2018-12-19 00:04:58.015000+00:00,lord of riots is pretty cool,
524738703403253782,2018-12-19 00:04:16.065000+00:00,the past two Rakdoses have been cool,
524738598172622850,2018-12-19 00:03:50.976000+00:00,he better not,
524738546955976704,2018-12-19 00:03:38.765000+00:00,hopefully Rakdos dosent suck,
524738497592950785,2018-12-19 00:03:26.996000+00:00,cuz being able to cheat some demon bois out sounds dope,
524738452428816385,2018-12-19 00:03:16.228000+00:00,i hope theres stuff to cheat cards out,
524738365191356456,2018-12-19 00:02:55.429000+00:00,contract should just be an alt win con,

524738108093366273,2018-12-19 00:01:54.132000+00:00,demon tribal should be about casting dope demon bois,
524738008151359515,2018-12-19 00:01:30.304000+00:00,but thats lame,

520704943842131987,2018-12-07 20:55:32.842000+00:00,idk about keeping the theme a secret,
520704871331135491,2018-12-07 20:55:15.554000+00:00,yeah its kind of hard to judge,
520704825818742810,2018-12-07 20:55:04.703000+00:00,thinking of a theme is hard,
520704743786545153,2018-12-07 20:54:45.145000+00:00,could be fun,
520571238956138506,2018-12-07 12:04:15.113000+00:00,You're not going to have an easy time winning with a group hug deck,
520564904793735178,2018-12-07 11:39:04.931000+00:00,it wad decided ray won one turn after you left,
520438442325311500,2018-12-07 03:16:33.929000+00:00,<@!332566686488199188> incase you were curios it was decided that Ray won,

520393628020113438,2018-12-07 00:18:29.366000+00:00,oh,
520393540988174336,2018-12-07 00:18:08.616000+00:00,what is gaybees,
520036721681760259,2018-12-06 00:40:16.264000+00:00,but honestly i feel like having just a few single target removal spells is worth it,
520036649468559388,2018-12-06 00:39:59.047000+00:00,board wipes are def more necessary than single target,
520030243294281729,2018-12-06 00:14:31.696000+00:00,lol if everyone had that attuitude no one would be able to do anything,
520030035638353923,2018-12-06 00:13:42.187000+00:00,what do you do when your opponent combos off?,
520029929618931722,2018-12-06 00:13:16.910000+00:00,yeah but its important to have some,
520029689075728384,2018-12-06 00:12:19.560000+00:00,u suk,
520029683081936897,2018-12-06 00:12:18.131000+00:00,hmm,
520029385512845314,2018-12-06 00:11:07.185000+00:00,looks like you need more removal,
520029353447522324,2018-12-06 00:10:59.540000+00:00,hmm,
520028380620521483,2018-12-06 00:07:07.600000+00:00,yeah stuff like that can be pretty risky,
520027022450229258,2018-12-06 00:01:43.787000+00:00,makes sense,
520026482941100054,2018-12-05 23:59:35.158000+00:00,but without the hexproof people are just going to save removal for when she does her thing,
520026397381492768,2018-12-05 23:59:14.759000+00:00,dang,
520026339126804480,2018-12-05 23:59:00.870000+00:00,even if its not necessarily as good,
520026272781434890,2018-12-05 23:58:45.052000+00:00,i think i would have more fun with voltron if i were making that deck,
520026228665614356,2018-12-05 23:58:34.534000+00:00,fair enough,
520025785130680321,2018-12-05 23:56:48.787000+00:00,just make your hexproof commander huge,
520025747616956427,2018-12-05 23:56:39.843000+00:00,she seems more fun,
520025503915311106,2018-12-05 23:55:41.740000+00:00,i like her as a commander for what you're doing more,
520025250092810261,2018-12-05 23:54:41.224000+00:00,nice one drop,
520025220246142976,2018-12-05 23:54:34.108000+00:00,i like rancor,

520025073403297795,2018-12-05 23:53:59.098000+00:00,is it just a bunch of nice enchantments,
520025047918837780,2018-12-05 23:53:53.022000+00:00,whats the deck trying to do?,
520024759530946562,2018-12-05 23:52:44.265000+00:00,and only 71 dang,
520024717965656064,2018-12-05 23:52:34.355000+00:00,lol,
520024224622968832,2018-12-05 23:50:36.733000+00:00,why,

519690387502399506,2018-12-05 01:44:03.761000+00:00,just do every free response ever released,
519690344254930966,2018-12-05 01:43:53.450000+00:00,so we got a 100,
519690327871848463,2018-12-05 01:43:49.544000+00:00,and one of the free responses we practiced on was on the test,
519690282665508876,2018-12-05 01:43:38.766000+00:00,lmao last year me and Ethan were studying for a test,

517896358552928277,2018-11-30 02:55:13.928000+00:00,i acutally got brennar to not kill me for a turn,
517896149894692875,2018-11-30 02:54:24.180000+00:00,it worked out pretty well for him the game we played,

517892805344100352,2018-11-30 02:41:06.777000+00:00,so you would have won either way,

517892611843817472,2018-11-30 02:40:20.643000+00:00,yeah honestly your deck did pretty well,
517892560728096768,2018-11-30 02:40:08.456000+00:00,since ghave is hard to play and its easy to be wrong when doing stuff,
517892510559895572,2018-11-30 02:39:56.495000+00:00,yeah definatly pay attention when i think i have a combo,

517892264396324865,2018-11-30 02:38:57.805000+00:00,so you win that game,
517892253499392010,2018-11-30 02:38:55.207000+00:00,that would have killed me,
517892236185436200,2018-11-30 02:38:51.079000+00:00,damn,
517892181256830996,2018-11-30 02:38:37.983000+00:00,how much damage were you about to do to me?,
517888150706716682,2018-11-30 02:22:37.025000+00:00,because i had ashnods alter i could have just killed ghave and recasted him for cheaper,
517887963225391166,2018-11-30 02:21:52.326000+00:00,and then won,
517887952840294490,2018-11-30 02:21:49.850000+00:00,or i would have just destroyed jacks lands,
517887899895857152,2018-11-30 02:21:37.227000+00:00,and brennar might have killed me,
517887877158404097,2018-11-30 02:21:31.806000+00:00,jack would have put me really low,
517887831494885377,2018-11-30 02:21:20.919000+00:00,is i would have destroyed all of brennars lands,
517887803212693529,2018-11-30 02:21:14.176000+00:00,so i think what would have happend that game,
517887738763280386,2018-11-30 02:20:58.810000+00:00,and then i can just cheat normally,

517887598421606420,2018-11-30 02:20:25.350000+00:00,this is extreamly true,
517880758405431338,2018-11-30 01:53:14.563000+00:00,i would not have been able to touch much of jacks,
517880714000203807,2018-11-30 01:53:03.976000+00:00,so while i could have wiped most of your lands,
517880613509005312,2018-11-30 01:52:40.017000+00:00,ghave had a limited number of +1/+1 counters,

517828115561447455,2018-11-29 22:24:03.531000+00:00,it runs propaganda and ghostly prison,
517828070367952923,2018-11-29 22:23:52.756000+00:00,which could be hard since part of that deck is a prison strat,
517827852947816473,2018-11-29 22:23:00.919000+00:00,makes sense,
517827660446171154,2018-11-29 22:22:15.023000+00:00,its very cheap,
517827540208058370,2018-11-29 22:21:46.356000+00:00,theoretically,
517827503130279945,2018-11-29 22:21:37.516000+00:00,which shouldnt be too hard in group hug,
517827196652617729,2018-11-29 22:20:24.446000+00:00,but i kind of like it in group hug,

517825298880790528,2018-11-29 22:12:51.982000+00:00,since stalwart is group hug you do a lot of helping,

517823918719893552,2018-11-29 22:07:22.926000+00:00,i really like !card Chasm Skulker,
517823848201191424,2018-11-29 22:07:06.113000+00:00,looking at stalwart unity,
517823751379877897,2018-11-29 22:06:43.029000+00:00,i just cant help but think that its not the best color combo for what you want to do,
517823509292908554,2018-11-29 22:05:45.311000+00:00,and red gives you access to way more x spells,

517823190421209100,2018-11-29 22:04:29.286000+00:00,oh brennar i finnaly thought of the commander that might be good for your deck,
517822974745640970,2018-11-29 22:03:37.865000+00:00,if you're doing budget its easier to use commanders with less colors,
517822820085006339,2018-11-29 22:03:00.991000+00:00,3 colors is a sweet spot for commander from what ive seen,
517822749398269954,2018-11-29 22:02:44.138000+00:00,since lands are the most expensive part of magic,
517822723058302986,2018-11-29 22:02:37.858000+00:00,i'll also warn you that more colors = more expensive,
517822655378751490,2018-11-29 22:02:21.722000+00:00,so no one really wants to kill you,
517822633266642954,2018-11-29 22:02:16.450000+00:00,thats when you help everybody,
517822610915196970,2018-11-29 22:02:11.121000+00:00,group hug could be interesting,
517822540346032129,2018-11-29 22:01:54.296000+00:00,and some of the precons will be really expensive,
517822484590886936,2018-11-29 22:01:41.003000+00:00,most of these wont have precons mind you,
517822426864812035,2018-11-29 22:01:27.240000+00:00,lol,

517821220759011329,2018-11-29 21:56:39.682000+00:00,but that would defiantly not constitute as a surprise,
517821150794088470,2018-11-29 21:56:23.001000+00:00,instead of buying a precon,
517821132930416652,2018-11-29 21:56:18.742000+00:00,honestly you could also look up a budget list online,

517820804222812180,2018-11-29 21:55:00.372000+00:00,at this point if i want something expensive i just ask them or buy it myself,
517820700510126095,2018-11-29 21:54:35.645000+00:00,my parents stopped doing that years ago,

514262965239676970,2018-11-20 02:17:25.457000+00:00,yeah theres a verstion on mtg goldfish thats less than 400,
514262269367156746,2018-11-20 02:14:39.548000+00:00,or infect without noble Hierarch,
514262114999730176,2018-11-20 02:14:02.744000+00:00,what about gruul land destruction?,

514261762120351746,2018-11-20 02:12:38.611000+00:00,like a play set is half the cost of some of those decks,
514261708613746704,2018-11-20 02:12:25.854000+00:00,I was looking at the meta decks and Noble Hierarch is just insane in price,

514258446170849280,2018-11-20 01:59:28.027000+00:00,after making like 5 commander decks its fun to actually know what most of the cards in the spoilers do,
514258215782055974,2018-11-20 01:58:33.098000+00:00,we'll see,

511657272410243082,2018-11-12 21:43:19.875000+00:00,although i could probably make a kaalia punisher deck,
511657077928755209,2018-11-12 21:42:33.507000+00:00,since i didnt see anyone i really liked in the RWB colors,

511656785375920166,2018-11-12 21:41:23.757000+00:00,and then i realized what i did was even worse since i cheated her out turn 4/5 lol,
511656718556725279,2018-11-12 21:41:07.826000+00:00,and how she costs 9 mana and is an end of game card,

511656649585328148,2018-11-12 21:40:51.382000+00:00,so im watching the command zone,
511655184607346688,2018-11-12 21:35:02.104000+00:00,but white also gives me more protection,
511655047017529364,2018-11-12 21:34:29.300000+00:00,this card almost makes me want to splash white,

511281520091332618,2018-11-11 20:50:13.541000+00:00,just because mogis is a lot more varied,
511281461886713966,2018-11-11 20:49:59.664000+00:00,I think i like mogis better than kaalia,

510557207860084757,2018-11-09 20:52:04.048000+00:00,also if anything we should just add a price limit,
510556078027702293,2018-11-09 20:47:34.675000+00:00,since it grabs aurelia,

510555262512267268,2018-11-09 20:44:20.241000+00:00,since i dont think nightveil predator is great against non control decks,

510554058256285706,2018-11-09 20:39:33.124000+00:00,and then turn 5 just locked him out of the game,
510554026689953792,2018-11-09 20:39:25.598000+00:00,idk i just love how the guy waited hours to play Josh,
510553783655202868,2018-11-09 20:38:27.654000+00:00,yeah at some point in the video they mention how both of them own most cards printed,

510553331190464513,2018-11-09 20:36:39.778000+00:00,he actually has a pretty funny anecdote when they start talking about iona,
510553254308872220,2018-11-09 20:36:21.448000+00:00,https://youtu.be/cFXIj1TfULY?t=3229,

510551900039413760,2018-11-09 20:30:58.565000+00:00,its actually not even on the article they go over,
510550187735908378,2018-11-09 20:24:10.320000+00:00,meh it just speeds up the game,
510550131481903106,2018-11-09 20:23:56.908000+00:00,i didnt even put anything too bad in it,
510550059189010442,2018-11-09 20:23:39.672000+00:00,how?,
510550009847087159,2018-11-09 20:23:27.908000+00:00,focus is on using enchantments to deal damage every turn,
510549876191264771,2018-11-09 20:22:56.042000+00:00,but its pretty much a group slug/punisher style thing,

510548258431434762,2018-11-09 20:16:30.338000+00:00,i dont think its reasonable to get everything right,
510548110158725131,2018-11-09 20:15:54.987000+00:00,i can playtest 1v1 and the like,
510548057104842782,2018-11-09 20:15:42.338000+00:00,like how can i test for a game of 4 people?,
510547998485512213,2018-11-09 20:15:28.362000+00:00,thats not really feasible,
510547885260275712,2018-11-09 20:15:01.367000+00:00,"like removal, card draw etc",
510547842008350741,2018-11-09 20:14:51.055000+00:00,mostly staple stuff to put in if i think its lacking in any respect,

510547393025015828,2018-11-09 20:13:04.009000+00:00,like it shouldnt be that hard to side in for a creature like iona,
510547322728349706,2018-11-09 20:12:47.249000+00:00,i think your deck should be more flexible,
510546794644766724,2018-11-09 20:10:41.344000+00:00,a 3/3 shouldnt matter if it means taking out a beast like iona,

509105104956293120,2018-11-05 20:41:55.737000+00:00,id rather just spend money on my commander deck,
509105062526844956,2018-11-05 20:41:45.621000+00:00,yeah idk,
509104922072055819,2018-11-05 20:41:12.134000+00:00,idk it seems over priced,
509104838261604362,2018-11-05 20:40:52.152000+00:00,i wanna se that,
509104823505911839,2018-11-05 20:40:48.634000+00:00,ooh,
509104629292990467,2018-11-05 20:40:02.330000+00:00,which is kind of crazy,
509104604110127115,2018-11-05 20:39:56.326000+00:00,since i can kill someone the turn kaalia attakcs,
509104541216669697,2018-11-05 20:39:41.331000+00:00,so i dont pop off,
509104528143024130,2018-11-05 20:39:38.214000+00:00,I think kaalia might lead to you too just keeping me down,
509104453748654112,2018-11-05 20:39:20.477000+00:00,im game bb,
509104415244812288,2018-11-05 20:39:11.297000+00:00,😠,
509104395280187412,2018-11-05 20:39:06.537000+00:00,so i can deck test against another human,
509104369808048149,2018-11-05 20:39:00.464000+00:00,Either of you up for a game?,
509104263365001226,2018-11-05 20:38:35.086000+00:00,but the cuts for kaalia felt like they didnt really bring the deck down,
509104183014719498,2018-11-05 20:38:15.929000+00:00,like I feel like what i cut from ghave was some good shit,
509104119542317063,2018-11-05 20:38:00.796000+00:00,without me feeling like im cutting important things,
509104066295627782,2018-11-05 20:37:48.101000+00:00,its also cheaper,
509104041729458197,2018-11-05 20:37:42.244000+00:00,kaalia,
509104006933774356,2018-11-05 20:37:33.948000+00:00,after testing,
509103995126546443,2018-11-05 20:37:31.133000+00:00,so im prob going to order at the end of the month,
509103958929965056,2018-11-05 20:37:22.503000+00:00,honestly im really happy with kaalia,
509103925618671625,2018-11-05 20:37:14.561000+00:00,dope,
509103715777642507,2018-11-05 20:36:24.531000+00:00,since i can pull out so many threats if kaalia isnt answerd,
509103662895726616,2018-11-05 20:36:11.923000+00:00,it kind of destroys in 1v1 against rays rith deck,
509103599645753355,2018-11-05 20:35:56.843000+00:00,I was doing some testing and its pretty consistent,
509103224582701066,2018-11-05 20:34:27.421000+00:00,you're probably right,
509103144597323776,2018-11-05 20:34:08.351000+00:00,and make it harder to answer my threats,
509103050330472450,2018-11-05 20:33:45.876000+00:00,i like the idea of kind of fucking everybody over tbh,
509103001785335808,2018-11-05 20:33:34.302000+00:00,idk,
509102996890845208,2018-11-05 20:33:33.135000+00:00,yeah...,
509102940733177856,2018-11-05 20:33:19.746000+00:00,mardu allows me to put some sick boros creatures in too witch is nice,
509102774978609167,2018-11-05 20:32:40.227000+00:00,<@306204374881796107> what did you get,
509102735057223680,2018-11-05 20:32:30.709000+00:00,a lot of the creatures have an immediate benefit besides damage too,
509102613657288714,2018-11-05 20:32:01.765000+00:00,yeah i have some stuff to get around blockers,
509102462184194064,2018-11-05 20:31:25.651000+00:00,i only needed to take out like 3-5 creatures that were too expensive,
509102362426736680,2018-11-05 20:31:01.867000+00:00,and most of them aren't that expensive,
509102202741063692,2018-11-05 20:30:23.795000+00:00,you basically get to put a bunch of bombs in the deck,
509102143240798210,2018-11-05 20:30:09.609000+00:00,it seems like a really fun commander,
509097585311744002,2018-11-05 20:12:02.914000+00:00,the biggest problem its probably too reliant on kaalia,
509097408014319631,2018-11-05 20:11:20.643000+00:00,pretty much what you'd expect,
509097308961636352,2018-11-05 20:10:57.027000+00:00,https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/05-11-18-big-bois/,
509097304742035471,2018-11-05 20:10:56.021000+00:00,so I built a kaalia edh deck,
509096761915080704,2018-11-05 20:08:46.601000+00:00,well the command zone put out that stat that turn 1-3 sol ring decreases your win rate by about 2-3% on overage,
508843213428359169,2018-11-05 03:21:15.931000+00:00,that looks like a really good commander for red,
508843006124621824,2018-11-05 03:20:26.506000+00:00,lol,
508842841808568370,2018-11-05 03:19:47.330000+00:00,is the one with the target on their back,
508842809302974464,2018-11-05 03:19:39.580000+00:00,it looks like the person who gets ahead early,
508842779393261568,2018-11-05 03:19:32.449000+00:00,well after watching a couple of games,
508836154687225867,2018-11-05 02:53:12.996000+00:00,yeah the meta % for commander decks is much lower than for other formats,
508835045771968522,2018-11-05 02:48:48.610000+00:00,a lot of the meta decks are sub 200,
508834854801113108,2018-11-05 02:48:03.079000+00:00,kinda makes me want to spend less,
508834124367396879,2018-11-05 02:45:08.930000+00:00,why is that,
508834117668831232,2018-11-05 02:45:07.333000+00:00,on mtg goldfish the meta decks for commander 1v1 are like 10 times more expensive than the regular commander decks,
508833947182956547,2018-11-05 02:44:26.686000+00:00,i have a question,

508703751108952075,2018-11-04 18:07:05.523000+00:00,literally any commander deck,
508703549841080334,2018-11-04 18:06:17.537000+00:00,since they go in every commander deck,
508703495398883360,2018-11-04 18:06:04.557000+00:00,any other cards,
508703480370823178,2018-11-04 18:06:00.974000+00:00,also they command zone guys recommended getting lots of commander staples like sensies divining top over,
508703348384595978,2018-11-04 18:05:29.506000+00:00,ok,
508703290217857034,2018-11-04 18:05:15.638000+00:00,yeah,
508703235205234708,2018-11-04 18:05:02.522000+00:00,but im i dont want to spend that much money on my first deck,
508703177927950336,2018-11-04 18:04:48.866000+00:00,at some point if i keep using ghave i'll get it,
508702785215135744,2018-11-04 18:03:15.236000+00:00,yeah but not every deck im making will be a green token deck,
508702638481604608,2018-11-04 18:02:40.252000+00:00,"i was listening to the command zone and they were like ""yeah you literally never keep using your first deck""",
508702537264660490,2018-11-04 18:02:16.120000+00:00,so theres no point in spending big bucks on your first deck,
508702479186395147,2018-11-04 18:02:02.273000+00:00,and you're probably not going to be using it for the rest of your mtg career,
508702424417173516,2018-11-04 18:01:49.215000+00:00,do to it being your first,
508702395434532865,2018-11-04 18:01:42.305000+00:00,this will probably be one of the worst commander deck you make,
508702338077294612,2018-11-04 18:01:28.630000+00:00,so the thing is brennar,
508692892110553089,2018-11-04 17:23:56.536000+00:00,Aura shards is the most expensive card in there rn,

508486755360571392,2018-11-04 03:44:49.705000+00:00,making a volrton boros deck sounds fun,

508485209109561355,2018-11-04 03:38:41.050000+00:00,since i think its going to not end up being super expensive,

507644747997904946,2018-11-01 19:58:59.506000+00:00,its not unreasonable for someone to have at least one boardwipe/enchantment destruction spell,
507644644243275787,2018-11-01 19:58:34.769000+00:00,idk in a game of like 4 people,

507643923666305035,2018-11-01 19:55:42.970000+00:00,My decks overdue for a small rework,
507643457175814186,2018-11-01 19:53:51.750000+00:00,i just need to get some cheap tutor cards,
507643416440471555,2018-11-01 19:53:42.038000+00:00,so that shouldnt be a huge problem,
507643383641145347,2018-11-01 19:53:34.218000+00:00,part of my decks stratagey involves not attacking,
507643122272960522,2018-11-01 19:52:31.903000+00:00,and there ability to stop the combo,
507643089746264064,2018-11-01 19:52:24.148000+00:00,and then interfering with my opponents plans,
507643061417803776,2018-11-01 19:52:17.394000+00:00,my idea is to just focus on getting the combo,
507642798078689292,2018-11-01 19:51:14.609000+00:00,modern saprolings,
507642783214075915,2018-11-01 19:51:11.065000+00:00,to help me get the combo off,
507642751236702209,2018-11-01 19:51:03.441000+00:00,im thinking counter spells+card draw+some interference,
507642632139440139,2018-11-01 19:50:35.046000+00:00,what do you think about counter spells in the simic deck?,

502233691620114433,2018-10-17 21:37:23.133000+00:00,probably why i got so many hard decks with boros,

502233337839091743,2018-10-17 21:35:58.785000+00:00,and so by taking out rares and mythics,
502233257061122058,2018-10-17 21:35:39.526000+00:00,so i learned that you get matched up based on your deck and not on your ranks,

501540065177108480,2018-10-15 23:41:09.702000+00:00,to brenardos bois,
501540042104111116,2018-10-15 23:41:04.201000+00:00,I was thinking about adding some sinister sabotages,
501539978426449920,2018-10-15 23:40:49.019000+00:00,lol,
501539867621195806,2018-10-15 23:40:22.601000+00:00,its already too late,
501539848239185940,2018-10-15 23:40:17.980000+00:00,in my experince by the time the have a tefari out,
501523210550902784,2018-10-15 22:34:11.246000+00:00,If so than yeah that would be a solid card,
501523119346024491,2018-10-15 22:33:49.501000+00:00,Can he sacrifice planeswalkers?,
501521126325747712,2018-10-15 22:25:54.328000+00:00,I'm thinking of main boarding thief,
501521048945295391,2018-10-15 22:25:35.879000+00:00,On arena,
501521031270367252,2018-10-15 22:25:31.665000+00:00,Boros dimir sapos,
501505056839827456,2018-10-15 21:22:03.064000+00:00,I've never had too much trouble with golgari,
501504967287242752,2018-10-15 21:21:41.713000+00:00,Mono red is also annoying,
501487813515149314,2018-10-15 20:13:31.935000+00:00,its a big problem on arena but idk how many people are running that,
501487739594866708,2018-10-15 20:13:14.311000+00:00,apparently dan does,
501487691754504194,2018-10-15 20:13:02.905000+00:00,how many people play that type of deck at fnm?,
501487508069154817,2018-10-15 20:12:19.111000+00:00,but yeah he would be pretty good if i could get him out,
501487408202776578,2018-10-15 20:11:55.301000+00:00,hes expensive :/,
501487238488653842,2018-10-15 20:11:14.838000+00:00,its just so annoying that my victory is 100% down to luck,
501487183581151233,2018-10-15 20:11:01.747000+00:00,my win rate isnt bad against them,
501487069626105866,2018-10-15 20:10:34.578000+00:00,hence the banefire,
501487058771247105,2018-10-15 20:10:31.990000+00:00,since everything you do at that point is counterd,
501487024444801034,2018-10-15 20:10:23.806000+00:00,idk if card draw even matters,
501476182378676234,2018-10-15 19:27:18.856000+00:00,are there even any other draw spells in boros?,
501476082122489857,2018-10-15 19:26:54.953000+00:00,but those are just a burn most of the time,
501476055518019599,2018-10-15 19:26:48.610000+00:00,i do have risk factors,
501475942661881897,2018-10-15 19:26:21.703000+00:00,ok,
501475292641230849,2018-10-15 19:23:46.726000+00:00,in literally every game thats the card i need to win,
501475255815241748,2018-10-15 19:23:37.946000+00:00,its literally just a matter of getting banefire,
501221748394557441,2018-10-15 02:36:17.067000+00:00,its either that or blue black red control,
501221708318113812,2018-10-15 02:36:07.512000+00:00,oh my god why is everyone playing jesaki control,
501084663604051989,2018-10-14 17:31:33.506000+00:00,wow and i just won the third game by being so aggresive that he couldnt do anything,
501083877633294366,2018-10-14 17:28:26.116000+00:00,honestly the strategy thats working for me rn is to burn my opponent with spells,
501083793537368074,2018-10-14 17:28:06.066000+00:00,yeet risk factored into a banefire,
501081470669029397,2018-10-14 17:18:52.251000+00:00,no banefire 😦,
501081030934003732,2018-10-14 17:17:07.410000+00:00,all i need is a banefire to win,
501080670312071168,2018-10-14 17:15:41.431000+00:00,oh boy he got his tefari out,
501080388970479616,2018-10-14 17:14:34.354000+00:00,considering 90% of the decks i face in comp are controol its a pretty good mainbaord rn,
501079204717133834,2018-10-14 17:09:52.006000+00:00,oh boy looks like this time its a jesaki deck,
501078961678188567,2018-10-14 17:08:54.061000+00:00,or blue black red control,
501078942774591488,2018-10-14 17:08:49.554000+00:00,like i feel like half the decks i see are either jesaki,
501078903998119956,2018-10-14 17:08:40.309000+00:00,im so tired of all these control decks though,
501076351164481546,2018-10-14 16:58:31.666000+00:00,like half of the games im winning right now are completly because of banefire,
501060994257125378,2018-10-14 15:57:30.294000+00:00,i actually feel good about myself,
501060967702986762,2018-10-14 15:57:23.963000+00:00,yay i beat the jesaki deck,
501059411931037717,2018-10-14 15:51:13.038000+00:00,yeet i won game 2 with a banefire,
501058308266786820,2018-10-14 15:46:49.904000+00:00,a banefire would have won me the last game i had against jesakai control,
501057996722536451,2018-10-14 15:45:35.626000+00:00,22 i think,
501051964071608320,2018-10-14 15:21:37.330000+00:00,its pretty much the only way i feel like i have a chance of beating a good control deck,
501051898183417868,2018-10-14 15:21:21.621000+00:00,but idk,
501051873751465985,2018-10-14 15:21:15.796000+00:00,yeah,
501050208822755328,2018-10-14 15:14:38.846000+00:00,i have come to the conclusion that banefire should be in my boros deck,
501050157060849664,2018-10-14 15:14:26.505000+00:00,after destroying a control deck with it,

500473890443755520,2018-10-13 01:04:33.837000+00:00,so it ended up just netting me two extra cards i could play immediatly,
500473842712707082,2018-10-13 01:04:22.457000+00:00,but i didnt have enough mana for them anyway,
500473790527045634,2018-10-13 01:04:10.015000+00:00,and then used unmoored ego to get rid of the two aurelias i had,
500473742800191488,2018-10-13 01:03:58.636000+00:00,so some dude looked at my hand,

500106200080449548,2018-10-12 00:43:29.623000+00:00,awesome,
500076039720927243,2018-10-11 22:43:38.833000+00:00,but now i think its developed to a nice point,
500075885127401472,2018-10-11 22:43:01.975000+00:00,then lava coil conclave tribunal for stuff justice strike couldnt take care of,
500075761869520896,2018-10-11 22:42:32.588000+00:00,originally just had the knight of grace to sideboard against black decks,
500075506444533760,2018-10-11 22:41:31.690000+00:00,this is the first time ive had a sideboard im actually going to use,
500075225644400650,2018-10-11 22:40:24.742000+00:00,y r ur suggestions so good,
500074388683489300,2018-10-11 22:37:05.195000+00:00,I guess ill get the final version figured out with testing,
500074314239049728,2018-10-11 22:36:47.446000+00:00,I like the idea of turn 3 mentoring the falcon,
500074266214006786,2018-10-11 22:36:35.996000+00:00,s,
500074259830407169,2018-10-11 22:36:34.474000+00:00,I went ahead and switched the clarion for some boros challenger,
500073550884110336,2018-10-11 22:33:45.448000+00:00,absolutly,
500073430033498142,2018-10-11 22:33:16.635000+00:00,with the falcon,
500073416167129088,2018-10-11 22:33:13.329000+00:00,so i might switch those around,
500073371875278848,2018-10-11 22:33:02.769000+00:00,i think 4 dauntless bodygaurds is a little overboard,
500073321476390915,2018-10-11 22:32:50.753000+00:00,yeah that looks like a solid one drop,
500072899852369930,2018-10-11 22:31:10.230000+00:00,yeah i was debating between boros challenger and sunhome,
500072831472762880,2018-10-11 22:30:53.927000+00:00,but i figure its also probably good against token selesnya decks,
500072730511802429,2018-10-11 22:30:29.856000+00:00,yeah its mostly good against burn,
500072034852667393,2018-10-11 22:27:43.998000+00:00,although honestly it might be a better idea to replace two of them with Boros Challenger,
500071801053904906,2018-10-11 22:26:48.256000+00:00,so that my creatures cant take non combat damage,
500071717440585739,2018-10-11 22:26:28.321000+00:00,and i like the idea of using them to pretect tajic,
500071681428029450,2018-10-11 22:26:19.735000+00:00,I added the dauntless bodygaurds because a 2/1 body on turn one is solid,
500071403090083843,2018-10-11 22:25:13.374000+00:00,Goblin bannerette is a must have,
500071339604967444,2018-10-11 22:24:58.238000+00:00,skymarche aspirant seems good so i was thinking about having two of those in,
500071242460823593,2018-10-11 22:24:35.077000+00:00,still a little iffy on the one drops,
500071069672144896,2018-10-11 22:23:53.881000+00:00,I need copies of pretty much every card,

500066947069902848,2018-10-11 22:07:30.976000+00:00,night veil predator has been my mvp,
500066882091483158,2018-10-11 22:07:15.484000+00:00,like usually whenever i use it im already winning,
500066826525343757,2018-10-11 22:07:02.236000+00:00,in arena doom whisperer usually isnt a huge play,

499730010849017857,2018-10-10 23:48:39.121000+00:00,in a surveil deck you can use it every turn late game,
499729858398781440,2018-10-10 23:48:02.774000+00:00,yeah i think it works fine against control and midrange,

497587233876869130,2018-10-05 01:54:01.280000+00:00,probably so new players dont have to deal with blue white control decks,
497586837725118464,2018-10-05 01:52:26.830000+00:00,i dont play for the rank,
497576070975848518,2018-10-05 01:09:39.837000+00:00,and loose one to a guy whose like 3 ranks higher than me and almost get knocked down a rank,

497574128052862978,2018-10-05 01:01:56.608000+00:00,I now understand why ray said he would stop being my friend if i made a blue white control deck,
497557216338116608,2018-10-04 23:54:44.541000+00:00,yeah those board wipes suck,
497556963891085312,2018-10-04 23:53:44.353000+00:00,im going to try to put something together with boros,

497556525930250240,2018-10-04 23:51:59.935000+00:00,would aggro be good against it?,
497556399568715797,2018-10-04 23:51:29.808000+00:00,this is the 2nd one ive seen today,
497556329506799622,2018-10-04 23:51:13.104000+00:00,i cant beat it with my saproling deck,
497556294509658142,2018-10-04 23:51:04.760000+00:00,im not even goning to try,
497556170379362325,2018-10-04 23:50:35.165000+00:00,honestly,
497556163957882881,2018-10-04 23:50:33.634000+00:00,holy shit fuck blue white control,
497496366184923138,2018-10-04 19:52:56.734000+00:00,yes,
497252117229338624,2018-10-04 03:42:23.245000+00:00,board wiped and killed the opponent in one turn,
497252053211676672,2018-10-04 03:42:07.982000+00:00,each of us had about 5 creatures,
497252026200227851,2018-10-04 03:42:01.542000+00:00,i had 2 poison tip archers out,
497251973993857051,2018-10-04 03:41:49.095000+00:00,so the game looked pretty even,
497206906788511764,2018-10-04 00:42:44.236000+00:00,12 for normal,
497206891173117963,2018-10-04 00:42:40.513000+00:00,its 10 for heavily played,
497206846537596957,2018-10-04 00:42:29.871000+00:00,tcg player works for me,
497192539023998989,2018-10-03 23:45:38.694000+00:00,i helped,

497179157671968789,2018-10-03 22:52:28.331000+00:00,lol nice,
497179031372824577,2018-10-03 22:51:58.219000+00:00,which I think makes a big diffrence,
497179006915837963,2018-10-03 22:51:52.388000+00:00,also poision tip archer works with the opponents creatures too,
497178892113543187,2018-10-03 22:51:25.017000+00:00,so both abilitys can work really well for me,
497178856508358666,2018-10-03 22:51:16.528000+00:00,yeah but finality can also revive my tendershoots,
497178325203288065,2018-10-03 22:49:09.855000+00:00,in my experince with arena it elevates the deck to a whole other level,
497178273919402005,2018-10-03 22:48:57.628000+00:00,I think you're underestimating the cards,
497178179832905738,2018-10-03 22:48:35.196000+00:00,i can do a good amount of damage with this boi,
497178136828575759,2018-10-03 22:48:24.943000+00:00,and enough saprolings,
497178123184373791,2018-10-03 22:48:21.690000+00:00,if i have a slmefoot or poison tip archer out,

493499385519276034,2018-09-23 19:10:22.283000+00:00,but theres no point in using hostage taker if you dont plan on casting,

492902267402453013,2018-09-22 03:37:38.230000+00:00,hostage taker could definatly be a problem for you,

492902109168271371,2018-09-22 03:37:00.504000+00:00,lel,
492902088771108864,2018-09-22 03:36:55.641000+00:00,but I still rely heavily on my exlcusion mages and chups,
492902024690794507,2018-09-22 03:36:40.363000+00:00,not quuite,
492902007569645579,2018-09-22 03:36:36.281000+00:00,weeell,
492901945594347540,2018-09-22 03:36:21.505000+00:00,but cast down is not very important for my deck,
492901902892400650,2018-09-22 03:36:11.324000+00:00,fair,
492901809493508119,2018-09-22 03:35:49.056000+00:00,once you pop off you really pop off though,

492901479871545365,2018-09-22 03:34:30.468000+00:00,im thinking it would probably not be worth,
492901412125016065,2018-09-22 03:34:14.316000+00:00,yeah idk,
492900842714693632,2018-09-22 03:31:58.558000+00:00,but honestly im probably better off just playing more saprolings at that point,
492900786217680897,2018-09-22 03:31:45.088000+00:00,it could combo well with freyalise,
492900573860069376,2018-09-22 03:30:54.458000+00:00,at least 2/3 of the time id say,
492900506277117980,2018-09-22 03:30:38.345000+00:00,usually by the time i get dryad out i have 10,

492900210184421386,2018-09-22 03:29:27.751000+00:00,probably not,
492900188139159562,2018-09-22 03:29:22.495000+00:00,hmm,
492899874392768515,2018-09-22 03:28:07.692000+00:00,I just wish there was something more for fungi in the new set,

492415821675757569,2018-09-20 19:24:40.531000+00:00,like after trying to build something,
492415782806880258,2018-09-20 19:24:31.264000+00:00,honestly I feel like straight golgari isnt as  great as I thought it would be,
492415690763141122,2018-09-20 19:24:09.319000+00:00,and he still gets the effects of lands on the battlefield,
492415560655699973,2018-09-20 19:23:38.299000+00:00,he is a finisher for sure,
492415501516013608,2018-09-20 19:23:24.199000+00:00,lands still end up their,
492415474903023638,2018-09-20 19:23:17.854000+00:00,in the process of putting shit in your graveyard,
492415431588446219,2018-09-20 19:23:07.527000+00:00,so the thing is,
492415228806430731,2018-09-20 19:22:19.180000+00:00,whats your tapped out account btw?,
492415170795143188,2018-09-20 19:22:05.349000+00:00,but i think it works pretty well when you're putting lands into your graveyard,
492415079296532490,2018-09-20 19:21:43.534000+00:00,idk if brennar mentioned that to you,
492415037349167131,2018-09-20 19:21:33.533000+00:00,oh and <@217476956566978561> you should consider multani for your golgari deck,
492414925285621760,2018-09-20 19:21:06.815000+00:00,but i have work ugh,
492414902581854208,2018-09-20 19:21:01.402000+00:00,ill still study,
492414866074763294,2018-09-20 19:20:52.698000+00:00,thank god,
492414776266326068,2018-09-20 19:20:31.286000+00:00,are ap world tests cruved?,
492414737234133012,2018-09-20 19:20:21.980000+00:00,oof,
492413556986347563,2018-09-20 19:15:40.587000+00:00,especially if hes using the new planeswalker,
492413504079527948,2018-09-20 19:15:27.973000+00:00,I doubt hes running anything great in a golgari deck,
492411620216012800,2018-09-20 19:07:58.825000+00:00,2-3 is reasonable,
492411503438331915,2018-09-20 19:07:30.983000+00:00,yeah you want multiple copies so you have a nice likely hood to pull it,
492344379420311552,2018-09-20 14:40:47.370000+00:00,just use that,
492331228557606912,2018-09-20 13:48:31.960000+00:00,i mean there are some that are 4,
492330529165672448,2018-09-20 13:45:45.212000+00:00,yeah I imagne you'd need a lot of 4 dollar lands,
492330397288628244,2018-09-20 13:45:13.770000+00:00,I just remember there being a pretty good looing blue-black-green boi,
492330320482533406,2018-09-20 13:44:55.458000+00:00,ah,
492316089380765696,2018-09-20 12:48:22.499000+00:00,yeah I feel like a UBG would be a lot better than just straight BG,
492315960535941121,2018-09-20 12:47:51.780000+00:00,oh that guy?,
492313383140327424,2018-09-20 12:37:37.281000+00:00,whats that,
492313009268588544,2018-09-20 12:36:08.143000+00:00,and getting some surveil spells in there,
492312973046448139,2018-09-20 12:35:59.507000+00:00,and honestly I feel like it would greatly benefit from adding blue,
492312861889134633,2018-09-20 12:35:33.005000+00:00,so Im looking at making a golgari deck,
492175510332243968,2018-09-20 03:29:45.842000+00:00,since thats the biggest feature they havent added,
492175465780477982,2018-09-20 03:29:35.220000+00:00,which is nice,
492175420574269441,2018-09-20 03:29:24.442000+00:00,playing with friends is apparently at the top of their list,
492171823325118494,2018-09-20 03:15:06.791000+00:00,it would be nice to get some mtg arena stuff from the pre release,
492171728206823426,2018-09-20 03:14:44.113000+00:00,"""Select tabletop Guilds of Ravnica product will come with codes that are redeemable for in-game items in MTG Arena. These codes are not available in all regions.""",
492171714239922177,2018-09-20 03:14:40.783000+00:00,and,
492171620543102986,2018-09-20 03:14:18.444000+00:00,so guilds of ravnica comes out on the 27th for arena,
492164160940146698,2018-09-20 02:44:39.936000+00:00,and some guy left after he realized I could cast his legendary with hostage taker,

492020157770629151,2018-09-19 17:12:26.905000+00:00,then add 2x of the specters,

492019685970149415,2018-09-19 17:10:34.419000+00:00,its definatly a prority to take it out,
492019653837717528,2018-09-19 17:10:26.758000+00:00,like if your opponent has this creatures,
492019604298924052,2018-09-19 17:10:14.947000+00:00,I also feel like it would be a target,
492019370923655179,2018-09-19 17:09:19.306000+00:00,get some of dat card advantage,

492019070460493855,2018-09-19 17:08:07.670000+00:00,i think there are situations where it would be good,
492018781250387969,2018-09-19 17:06:58.717000+00:00,I know its not good against golgari or selsnya but i like it,
492018695137263617,2018-09-19 17:06:38.186000+00:00,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485897780016185355/492018695137263616/thiefofsanity1.png
492018692352376864,2018-09-19 17:06:37.522000+00:00,I think i might sideboard a few,
492016438970679308,2018-09-19 16:57:40.274000+00:00,so are you just going to sideboard 15 flyers if you need to fight me or something?,
492016240848535562,2018-09-19 16:56:53.038000+00:00,yeah its kind of bad,
492014975762694144,2018-09-19 16:51:51.418000+00:00,😦,
491956135302004736,2018-09-19 12:58:02.759000+00:00,oh thats cool,
491953317036163092,2018-09-19 12:46:50.832000+00:00,which seem like trash,
491953302880387074,2018-09-19 12:46:47.457000+00:00,probably not worth if if you dont have gates,
491951763780534312,2018-09-19 12:40:40.507000+00:00,ik,
491951504132145152,2018-09-19 12:39:38.602000+00:00,and took ap world,
491951502819328000,2018-09-19 12:39:38.289000+00:00,since i made poor life choices,
491951439292137473,2018-09-19 12:39:23.143000+00:00,i always have hw 😦,
491951211193434112,2018-09-19 12:38:28.760000+00:00,so as long as I dont have a lot of hw to procrastinate on I can play,
491951151894233106,2018-09-19 12:38:14.622000+00:00,but I get back at 7,
491951126028091393,2018-09-19 12:38:08.455000+00:00,I have work tonight,
491950974076846081,2018-09-19 12:37:32.227000+00:00,we should battle with our Brennardos Bois Decks,
491949269675409429,2018-09-19 12:30:45.866000+00:00,ah ok,
491948999159447563,2018-09-19 12:29:41.370000+00:00,so how does a draft differ?,
491948953885999114,2018-09-19 12:29:30.576000+00:00,good good,
491948366734032906,2018-09-19 12:27:10.588000+00:00,so how does the pre release work,
491948118447751180,2018-09-19 12:26:11.392000+00:00,I will buy it if i dont,
491948033932787712,2018-09-19 12:25:51.242000+00:00,that sounds like a pain for one card,
491947804244049920,2018-09-19 12:24:56.480000+00:00,so not a huge amount,
491946700374802432,2018-09-19 12:20:33.297000+00:00,ok I will,
491946313584214026,2018-09-19 12:19:01.079000+00:00,I have 4x Hostage taker,
491946244831313920,2018-09-19 12:18:44.687000+00:00,thought erasure probably,
491946223553478656,2018-09-19 12:18:39.614000+00:00,hmm,
491946213650858013,2018-09-19 12:18:37.253000+00:00,Cast down?,
491946097946918938,2018-09-19 12:18:09.667000+00:00,i can easlly get rid of a chupacabra for one,
491945775002025995,2018-09-19 12:16:52.671000+00:00,maybe i should add more,
491945760280018960,2018-09-19 12:16:49.161000+00:00,ive only got 2 of them in the deck,
491945648325918721,2018-09-19 12:16:22.469000+00:00,but fair,
491945639752499210,2018-09-19 12:16:20.425000+00:00,thats annoying,
491944704582090763,2018-09-19 12:12:37.463000+00:00,do these affect hexproof creatures?,
491932528114925578,2018-09-19 11:24:14.367000+00:00,but If I get some from packs Ill probably use em,
491932476524986368,2018-09-19 11:24:02.067000+00:00,idk if i want to buy them,
491932252817719297,2018-09-19 11:23:08.731000+00:00,youd need to use some heavy removal on that boi,
491932201785491477,2018-09-19 11:22:56.564000+00:00,doom whisperer is also scary,
491930011314421766,2018-09-19 11:14:14.315000+00:00,I lost a game to metcalf because I got swamp starved,
491929858444886018,2018-09-19 11:13:37.868000+00:00,so sometimes it can be hard to get him off turn 4,
491929788479700993,2018-09-19 11:13:21.187000+00:00,the only thing about hims is the fact that you need UUBB to summon him,
491929392096870400,2018-09-19 11:11:46.682000+00:00,and even then drake would die if he went up against hexproof boi since hes also got deathtouch,
491808952221433877,2018-09-19 03:13:11.578000+00:00,cuz of that hexproof boio,

491615965537107978,2018-09-18 14:26:19.967000+00:00,chances are you wont be able to cast more than a 3 or 4 drop,
491615823127904276,2018-09-18 14:25:46.014000+00:00,I could see it being good in some situations though,
491615608178343971,2018-09-18 14:24:54.766000+00:00,so you can use this card and cast like 1 or 2 spells the opponent has already casted,
491615447872176129,2018-09-18 14:24:16.546000+00:00,yeah thats not great,
491611284912209950,2018-09-18 14:07:44.019000+00:00,I was thinking I could use him to tap scary stuff,
491611148848857088,2018-09-18 14:07:11.579000+00:00,although yeah when I was play testing he was pretty useless,
491611077805604877,2018-09-18 14:06:54.641000+00:00,whats wrong with him,

491394453764964357,2018-09-17 23:46:07.445000+00:00,but then he counterd,
491394438069878805,2018-09-17 23:46:03.703000+00:00,then i enchanted a thopter ot be a 5/5,
491394194448056321,2018-09-17 23:45:05.619000+00:00,when u think ur winning about the opponent pulls out hero of dominario,

491393176658247720,2018-09-17 23:41:02.959000+00:00,I played my fumagate too early and lost,
491388845342851104,2018-09-17 23:23:50.293000+00:00,15 lands out before either of us did damage,
491388810261692427,2018-09-17 23:23:41.929000+00:00,I now know the pain of control vs control,

491331613083303938,2018-09-17 19:36:25.059000+00:00,only like 40 bucks for a set,
491330708850343977,2018-09-17 19:32:49.473000+00:00,if you have a lot of creatures its pretty good,
491330612011991040,2018-09-17 19:32:26.385000+00:00,yeah thats what im sayin,
491330476087181363,2018-09-17 19:31:53.978000+00:00,its especially nice when your opponent forgets about it,
491330329563496458,2018-09-17 19:31:19.044000+00:00,freyalise is real good if you got bois to use it with,
491329578145677313,2018-09-17 19:28:19.892000+00:00,devine visitation seems dope,

491259435411308544,2018-09-17 14:49:36.561000+00:00,thats what holden said,
491257246517428244,2018-09-17 14:40:54.688000+00:00,ill need to look at all the spoilers and start seeing how I want to implement new cards inot bbs,
491257145355141130,2018-09-17 14:40:30.569000+00:00,so even if one or both isnt amazing it could still have its place,
491257071803564032,2018-09-17 14:40:13.033000+00:00,yeah the options dual cards bring is the real advantage of them,
491256639169757184,2018-09-17 14:38:29.885000+00:00,dual card aint bad,
491256622312849408,2018-09-17 14:38:25.866000+00:00,hmm,
491213278832492544,2018-09-17 11:46:11.975000+00:00,yeah it does seem a bit niche,
491212650160848906,2018-09-17 11:43:42.088000+00:00,if you've got a lot of creatures out it could be good,
491212593806180352,2018-09-17 11:43:28.652000+00:00,it could allow you to launch one last large assault,
491212553662234646,2018-09-17 11:43:19.081000+00:00,eh idk,
491209547558682624,2018-09-17 11:31:22.370000+00:00,You would need to be very confidant in order to use that card,
491209452150718466,2018-09-17 11:30:59.623000+00:00,hmm interesting,

490975047704379392,2018-09-16 19:59:33.248000+00:00,Maybe a replacement for freebooter?,
490974976523108363,2018-09-16 19:59:16.277000+00:00,http://mythicspoiler.com/grn/cards/thiefofsanity.html,
490974964095123467,2018-09-16 19:59:13.314000+00:00,This card could be real good in my deck,
490971318099902475,2018-09-16 19:44:44.041000+00:00,Yeah that looks decent,
490966335241584642,2018-09-16 19:24:56.035000+00:00,So no,
490966314496557096,2018-09-16 19:24:51.089000+00:00,I'm going to say I got 50,

490966147127181312,2018-09-16 19:24:11.185000+00:00,But I guess we'll have to see,
490966055565393921,2018-09-16 19:23:49.355000+00:00,Tbh idk if I'm a good enough driver to pass,
490965976003903499,2018-09-16 19:23:30.386000+00:00,I'm going to try to get it before it starts snowing,
490965842385829898,2018-09-16 19:22:58.529000+00:00,So now I just needy license lel,
490965791550996510,2018-09-16 19:22:46.409000+00:00,I got a car,
490965684894040064,2018-09-16 19:22:20.980000+00:00,Like against red I'd probably rather have chups,
490965584607969309,2018-09-16 19:21:57.070000+00:00,I think it really depends on the situation,
490965508666163220,2018-09-16 19:21:38.964000+00:00,Hostage taker destroys green decks,
490965440122585099,2018-09-16 19:21:22.622000+00:00,So you can't just say use cast down,
490965341250387989,2018-09-16 19:20:59.049000+00:00,Since cast down can't destroy legendary,
490965262510850048,2018-09-16 19:20:40.276000+00:00,And it's destruction is better than cast down,
490965189965905941,2018-09-16 19:20:22.980000+00:00,It does what it needs to do,
490965131883184140,2018-09-16 19:20:09.132000+00:00,Chupicabra is fine,
490692410897072128,2018-09-16 01:16:27.382000+00:00,lol,
490692257121435649,2018-09-16 01:15:50.719000+00:00,I won my first couple of games,

489572552994455577,2018-09-12 23:06:32.452000+00:00,most of the golgori cards seem to do with graveyards,
489572507700166676,2018-09-12 23:06:21.653000+00:00,yeah id like to keep my focus on saprolings,
489572374149070851,2018-09-12 23:05:49.812000+00:00,it still made me go mmm,

489476074493968395,2018-09-12 16:43:10.185000+00:00,that might be a good idea,
489475179320311809,2018-09-12 16:39:36.759000+00:00,so it will hurt less to look at my bank account on firday,

489084987564359692,2018-09-11 14:49:07.795000+00:00,one of the cards i want is 50 dollars :/,
489084684500992000,2018-09-11 14:47:55.539000+00:00,and than a bunch of card drawing stuff,
489084655132475392,2018-09-11 14:47:48.537000+00:00,along with maybe a defnsive creature or two,
489084598446456854,2018-09-11 14:47:35.022000+00:00,so my plan rn is basically a bunc of counter stuff for early game,

489083709883023361,2018-09-11 14:44:03.172000+00:00,but what happens if they have a deck that utilizes the graveyard?,
489083659417157634,2018-09-11 14:43:51.140000+00:00,yeah i think i might just do mono blue,
489083601237835787,2018-09-11 14:43:37.269000+00:00,but there is a white card that prevents the opponent from using their graveyard,
489083540940521475,2018-09-11 14:43:22.893000+00:00,idk if im going to use more than just blue,

489083035879473162,2018-09-11 14:41:22.477000+00:00,theres another card that makes the opponent put 2 cards in there graveyard every time i draw,

488400410760052766,2018-09-09 17:28:51.966000+00:00,yeah ray had a broken combo in our first game,
488371153010688012,2018-09-09 15:32:36.375000+00:00,I don't think any other sarproling deck could beat him,
488371049906307073,2018-09-09 15:32:11.793000+00:00,And based on how rith works,
488366721997078538,2018-09-09 15:14:59.939000+00:00,Rith is insane,
488363420404678666,2018-09-09 15:01:52.778000+00:00,Slime foot is not a great commander,
488161446958465055,2018-09-09 01:39:18.556000+00:00,we could do something through google docs,
488160926412046347,2018-09-09 01:37:14.448000+00:00,hmm,
488160234175463427,2018-09-09 01:34:29.406000+00:00,!price riths charm,
488158984298037258,2018-09-09 01:29:31.412000+00:00,yeah ive never played,
488158728458076161,2018-09-09 01:28:30.415000+00:00,oh fuck that,
488158606676459521,2018-09-09 01:28:01.380000+00:00,but could use slimefoot,
488158577563926548,2018-09-09 01:27:54.439000+00:00,if i use rith i cant use pure black creatures right?,
488157698945449986,2018-09-09 01:24:24.960000+00:00,oh yeah rith seems solid,
488157226918477825,2018-09-09 01:22:32.420000+00:00,id hope i have a lot of saprolings out,
488157195285037096,2018-09-09 01:22:24.878000+00:00,i mean,
488156857320603649,2018-09-09 01:21:04.301000+00:00,i mean the point is to let saprolings die to do damage and heal,
488156556605652993,2018-09-09 01:19:52.605000+00:00,the point is to sacrifice saprolings to aid it,
488156523076517889,2018-09-09 01:19:44.611000+00:00,the point of slimefoot is not to do damage with it,
488156298198777877,2018-09-09 01:18:50.996000+00:00,it will do a lot,
488156268326813726,2018-09-09 01:18:43.874000+00:00,if i have a very large amount of saprolings,

488155069439803412,2018-09-09 01:13:58.037000+00:00,how does it work?,
488155037512499220,2018-09-09 01:13:50.425000+00:00,what does the commander even do?,
488154669718175764,2018-09-09 01:12:22.736000+00:00,what makes a good commander?,
488154117496373248,2018-09-09 01:10:11.076000+00:00,slimefoot is real good,

487633230049181696,2018-09-07 14:40:21.831000+00:00,if it saves space,
487633216522682371,2018-09-07 14:40:18.606000+00:00,I cant argue with ur curly bracket argument,
487633146146455553,2018-09-07 14:40:01.827000+00:00,since u use keys,
487633131588026378,2018-09-07 14:39:58.356000+00:00,and dicts format a slightly diffrent way,

487632777538306064,2018-09-07 14:38:33.944000+00:00,dicts use {},
487632755346243594,2018-09-07 14:38:28.653000+00:00,lists use [],
487632743455260693,2018-09-07 14:38:25.818000+00:00,and in python you cant do things diffrent,
487632655022817301,2018-09-07 14:38:04.734000+00:00,not lists,
487632620281266192,2018-09-07 14:37:56.451000+00:00,I actually really like condensing code down as far as possible in python,
487632558549499904,2018-09-07 14:37:41.733000+00:00,well pytho dosent use brackets,

487631207518175233,2018-09-07 14:32:19.622000+00:00,no,
487631178761764864,2018-09-07 14:32:12.766000+00:00,you could have the whole program on one line if you wanted lol,
487631141508218891,2018-09-07 14:32:03.884000+00:00,so you can organize stuff however you want,
487631116023496705,2018-09-07 14:31:57.808000+00:00,since you can have anything on anyline,

487630936356159509,2018-09-07 14:31:14.972000+00:00,and you have to physically write out the code,

486529104372301848,2018-09-04 13:32:57.756000+00:00,u can only borrow the crappy fungus decks,
486506636832276480,2018-09-04 12:03:41.077000+00:00,in can justify buying another deck to myself,
486506602963271723,2018-09-04 12:03:33.002000+00:00,since the pre release is basically october,

486372562885017614,2018-09-04 03:10:55.357000+00:00,none of these cards are rotating out,
486372449840267264,2018-09-04 03:10:28.405000+00:00,since its only 30 bucks,

486371270355582986,2018-09-04 03:05:47.194000+00:00,which would have made them 5/5s,
486371242686021643,2018-09-04 03:05:40.597000+00:00,i also had another tendorshoot in my hand,
486371132099002369,2018-09-04 03:05:14.231000+00:00,this is basically the ideal scenario for this deck,

486362591934021653,2018-09-04 02:31:18.097000+00:00,than depending on how much that is we'll see,
486362528738312214,2018-09-04 02:31:03.030000+00:00,ill probably spend money to make sure brenardos bois is the best it can be first,

486354446083817482,2018-09-04 01:58:55.975000+00:00,freyalise is defiantly good for an all out attack,

486229184352354315,2018-09-03 17:41:11.251000+00:00,i think i can make it work,
486229099577212955,2018-09-03 17:40:51.039000+00:00,fungus decks is pretty weak,

486032911553003530,2018-09-03 04:41:16.169000+00:00,Brennar said to send them a message lol,
486032622896545802,2018-09-03 04:40:07.348000+00:00,"I think he thought there was something more going on with ""attacking"" and ""blocking""",
486032451299442699,2018-09-03 04:39:26.436000+00:00,im with you,
486032444319989760,2018-09-03 04:39:24.772000+00:00,i mean,
486032183794860044,2018-09-03 04:38:22.658000+00:00,jay is just overcomplicating it in his head,
486032022796500992,2018-09-03 04:37:44.273000+00:00,ur the one who made it confusing by bringing other stuff into it,

486021149268901888,2018-09-03 03:54:31.822000+00:00,i didnt really know that,
486019316488208384,2018-09-03 03:47:14.853000+00:00,it just comes down to the numbers,
486019280316530700,2018-09-03 03:47:06.229000+00:00,there is no real  diffrence between blocker and attacker,
486019161575653377,2018-09-03 03:46:37.919000+00:00,i feel like you're making it out to be more complicated than it is,
486019067074052117,2018-09-03 03:46:15.388000+00:00,yeahg,
486018730795597844,2018-09-03 03:44:55.213000+00:00,the attacker needs a power equal to or greater than the blockers health to kill it,
486018340960206848,2018-09-03 03:43:22.269000+00:00,rays talking about more than a 1 on 1 there,
486018242356314112,2018-09-03 03:42:58.760000+00:00,"this? ""Say a 3/3 gets blocked by a 2/1, the 3/3 has 1 health left and if it takes 1 more damage say from a shock (deal 2 damage) it dies""",
486018166552657920,2018-09-03 03:42:40.687000+00:00,where?,

486018086713950210,2018-09-03 03:42:21.652000+00:00,i believe,
486018063829827584,2018-09-03 03:42:16.196000+00:00,and neither die,
486018047878889483,2018-09-03 03:42:12.393000+00:00,it gets blocked,
